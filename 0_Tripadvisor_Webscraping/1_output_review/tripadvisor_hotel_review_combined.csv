 Jan 2020,50,THIS IS A WONDERFUL HOSTEL IN BANGKOK THAT I RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE,"I really love this quite and friendly Hostel - it is a wonderful hidden Gem that is off the beaten path that makes you feel like you are staying in an authentic old Thai neighborhood away from the hustle and bustle. You are greeted by their welcoming staff with a refreshing glass of Butterfly Pea Tea - it is an ancient Thai Herbal plant that is extremely thirst quenching, relaxing and healthy. The rooms are spacious, clean and airy with lots of natural light. They have several different dorm and private rooms that offers a refreshing feel of privacy - having blackout curtains in every Pod. Hides bathrooms are spacious, clean and modern with consistent flow of hot water. What I like best is you can sleep-in without worrying about missing out on the substantial free breakfast they offer - as they do not clear it away until their guests have had time to enjoy it at their leisure. I enjoy cooking my own meals as I travel through Asia and they are very excepting to guests using the kitchen to prepare their dinner while having the opportunity of socializing with the interesting and friendly guests that stay @ Hide from all over the world. The prices at Hide are as competitive and lower than any of the other Hostels in Bangkok Thailand. I highly recommend the 5 Star Hide Hostel Bangkok to everyone and I am so happy that I have had the opportunity to experience this little piece of Paradice in Thailand.  Spacious rooms · Private bathrooms · Quiet rooms · Private rooms · Good for backpackers",HIDE BANGKOK HOSTEL,13.706567,100.596489
 Jul 2019,50,A hostel with a hint of home,"I arrived at the hostel and was greated with the staff and a welcome drink 🍸. The stay at the hostel was amazing. This is cleanest hostel I have been to very clean and tidy. The staff is very welcoming and happy. The other guests at the hostel where very happy, and welcoming. I made new contacts with other guests. We book the room for 3 people with an en-suite, this room was very spacious.    When    There is no mini bar in the room from my experience. The is a community fridge/ freezer (you are required to label your food/ drink), sink, plates and cutlery in the kitchen.    There is no safe anywhere. BUT there is plenty of CCTV in the building for the security of you and your belongings. This was useful for me as it remained me my belongings I left in the room are safe.    There is AIR-Condition in the community sleeping rooms running from 8:00- 10:00 ever day. This is not applied in private rooms. I have great hearing, I could not hear any A/C units from our room or anywhere in the building (even though it was below the window, of our room, rooms may differ)    The location is a bit hidden (hint the name of the hostel 😅). But the community around the area pointed me in the right direction.    I really enjoyed staying here and I will definitely be back.    See you again Hide.",HIDE BANGKOK HOSTEL,13.706567,100.596489

 Dec 2018,50,"Very nice, clean hostel. Very friendly and helpful staffs","I stayed in this hostel for 4 days. Really love this hostel. Quite, clean, friendly and green! Very nice. Only 5-min walking to On Nut BTS, theres mall, supermarket, and clothing market as well. The vendor food at the clothing market is very nice",HIDE BANGKOK HOSTEL,13.706567,100.596489
 Aug 2018,50,Homey Atmosphere,"This hostel will let you feel like you are at your own crib! It was raining when we arrived at the hostel. We were welcomed by 2 or 3 ladies with umbrellas and helped us with our luggage. Upon entering the hostel, they have a policy to remove your footwear before entering and we saw everyone inside barefoot (what a cooperation!) We were served a very colorful welcome drink. The ladies are very helpful and you can barely see in their faces that they wanted to engage on a conversation with you, but the language barrier is big hindrance. We were just on the first floor, the location of the room is not up to my preference as it is near the staircase, but it's okay as we are leaving in just couple of hours for a flight. For our midnight snack, we had our food take away and we decided to eat it at their dining table. This is the feeling I liked most, sitting with my partner in a long dining table, we're having our midnight snack and a small talk together. Aside from that, they have a small room with washing machine on it, iron and ironing board, kitchenette, it is good for long staying guests. The most important is that you could leave your luggage for 15 days free of charge while you are about to visit another island in their country! Their location however is not that easy to find, but it's also nice on the other hand as it is away from all the noise you hear during your day trips! Definitely recommendable!",HIDE BANGKOK HOSTEL,13.706567,100.596489
 Jun 2018,50,Cheap and good,"We got the standard double room with shower. The room was spacious and clean. The hostel was clean and the staff were very nice and greeted us with a very warm greeting. The staff was very helpful in letting us know the best way to the nearest BTS (On Nut BTS). According to Google maps, it would require a 10 minutes walk from On Nut BTS to the hostel. With the heat in Bangkok, it was no joke. However, outside of Tesco, there are the motorcycle taxis which can bring you to the hostel for only 10 bhat! Also, when walking out of the hostel there are also motorcycle taxis which can bring you to the BTS station for also 10 bhat. As the hostel is located in a small alley, it might get a little dark at night but it gets very peaceful at night. Totally loved it. They provided free breakfast in the morning with cereal, bread, etc. There are also washing machines and dryers to do your laundry for only 30 bhat. However, the water pressure in the bathroom is a little low. Above all else, a great stay! Will definitely come back again.",HIDE BANGKOK HOSTEL,13.706567,100.596489
 Jun 2018,40,Comfy beds,With great king-size beds and an ensuite it did not feel like a city hostel but it was what we needed after a long flight! Perfect for that jetlag!

We booked a double room with deck & private bath which was a good size with a/c & mini fridge. The room was fairly clean, for some reason in Thailand, walls are neglected, but floors are spotless.

 Jul 2017,50,Nice and clean,"This hostel is in a quiet and small alley , and it's about 10 Mons walk from BTS On Nut station. There's local stores and some Cafe, restaurants and 7-11 nearby.    The hostel is really clean and modern. We stayed in a private room, which is spacious and has a lil balcony. The bathroom is pretty new and clean.    The staff is super friendly. Though they don't speak fluent English, they still try their best to help and chat with us.    They provide free coffee and tea 24hrs, also free breakfast, which includes toast, cereal , bananas and milk. If you wanna do laundry they have washing machine and dryer at 1st floor. You will have to pay 30 baht per use.    Overall, we had a really comfortable stay , and I would recommend Hide Bangkok to whoever has tight budget and doesn't mind to stay a bit away from the city center.",HIDE BANGKOK HOSTEL,13.706567,100.596489
 Jun 2017,50,Wonderful Hostel,"My fiancée and I stayed at Hide for 5 nights. We had a private room and bathroom that we booked through Agoda. Check in was simple and only a 100 baht key deposit was required. The hostel was spotless, I was very impressed with how clean they kept it. Our room was a good size and the bathroom was also very nice with a shower, toilet, and sink. They provide complimentary breakfast in the mornings (which is cereal, some fruit, and some coffee/tea) and also will provide clothes hangers or a hair dryer if you need one. There is a Tesco, some bars, a 7 Eleven, cafes, and street food near the hostel. The neighborhood is quiet and much nicer than Khao San Rd. Although the Hostel is not very near the main attractions in Bangkok it is very accessible to get anywhere using public transportation. There is a BTS station right by the Tesco (buy pass instead of individual tickets) and you can access the MRT or water taxis to get anywhere by using the BTS. The only downside is it can be a little hard to find when you arrive but on their Facebook page they provide a map and directions in Thai to give to your taxi driver from the airport (alternatively you could take the rail link to the BTS and find it using the map that way).    Hide is wonderful and we will definitely stay here again if we are in Bangkok.",HIDE BANGKOK HOSTEL,13.706567,100.596489
 May 2017,40,First days in Bangkok,"The first what the touch us was friendly staff. This place is made special because of the staff which try to help you in every way.  The breakfast was modest with coffe, milk, tea, bread, butter or homemade jam, which enough.  Location was little far from the centrum of the Bangkok.  My opinion is that the accomodation( bequem room with cool clima) and the service is very friendly with the price. The room was nicely clean.  Thank you",HIDE BANGKOK HOSTEL,13.706567,100.596489
 May 2017,50,Nice hostel for backpackers,"This hostel is tucked away down a couple of streets off Sukhumvit Road, near On Nut BTS. Nearby is some great streetfood and a massive Tesco Lotus.    The room itself had great AC, was modern clean & cheap. Towels were not provided, but could be rented for 20b plus deposit. This hostel would suit those looking to chill out or do sightseeing in Bangkok, it is certainly not a place to party.    Friendly staff, a small breakfast and laundry facilities were nice little extras. I would stay here again",HIDE BANGKOK HOSTEL,13.706567,100.596489

 Nov 2016,40,Great!,"Base on the map, the hostel looks close from bts. However it's almost a 10 mins walk from On nut BTS and along the way, there are many Low cables or wires so be careful!    However, taking a GrabCar from Tesco to the hostel is only 50baht.  Tesco has amazing foodcourt!    The hostel also has free refillable water and even has a washer and dryer at a cost of 25baht.    We stayed in a private room and the room was spacious. What lack was probably a fridge to store some of our own stuff. But it'd do!    There is no lift just stairs. But there's automated lift for your heavy bags!    Staffs are polite and friendly.  Would stay here again!",HIDE BANGKOK HOSTEL,13.706567,100.596489

 Sep 2019,50,Great for a one night airport stopover,"We bboked here as a one night stopover, for Bangkok airport, which is a 15 minute ride away, traffic was terrible. We had origionally booked a room, but it was up on a higher floor, so when checking in, the receptionist got me to cancel that one, and we got booked into one of the new rooms, behind the main hotel, on the ground floor, as we had 2 massive suitcases. The room only cost about £20 for the night, and a free taxi ride back to airport next day. Very clean room, looked very new, soft bed and pillows, great shower, toiletries, good WIFI, TV, hairdrier..  As its a hostel, there was a microwave, toast, in the hallway, so as we arrived late, I went to the local 7Eleven store, 5 mins away, bought toasties, crisps and beers for supper rather than going out.

The hostel itself is small but the rooms are comfortable to fit three people and all our luggage. They offer breakfast every morning for an additional charge but we enjoyed the chicken and pork soup as well as the fried rice we ordered for our breakfast. The front desk staff were extremely helpful and polite. They helped teach us some Thai phrases and helped us get to the Chatuchak Weekend Market.

Scheduled airport drop off is free of charge and takes the stress off getting to airport on time. Our go to place if landing at DMK from this point on.

The taxi to the hostel was 110baht. The free shuttle ride to the airport the next day was awesome. They ask you at check in what time your flight is and what time you want to leave. Our shuttle driver was on his phone the whole time, but it was quick and it’s fine.    I would 100% stay here again and recommend this hostel to anyone.

If you want to catch a train to ayutthaya or north, this is place to stay since it is close to the station next to airport. breakfast was good. The room was also spacious enough for two.

We were flying to Myanmar and were worried about our weight limit so they were kind enough to let us leave a bag and pick it up on our return. Nice room with a good AC.
