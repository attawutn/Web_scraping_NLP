alisdair t wrote a review Sep 2019,50,Great for a one night airport stopover,"We bboked here as a one night stopover, for Bangkok airport, which is a 15 minute ride away, traffic was terrible. We had origionally booked a room, but it was up on a higher floor, so when checking in, the receptionist got me to cancel that one, and we got booked into one of the new rooms, behind the main hotel, on the ground floor, as we had 2 massive suitcases. The room only cost about £20 for the night, and a free taxi ride back to airport next day. Very clean room, looked very new, soft bed and pillows, great shower, toiletries, good WIFI, TV, hairdrier..  As its a hostel, there was a microwave, toast, in the hallway, so as we arrived late, I went to the local 7Eleven store, 5 mins away, bought toasties, crisps and beers for supper rather than going out.

They offer breakfast every morning for an additional charge but we enjoyed the chicken and pork soup as well as the fried rice we ordered for our breakfast. The front desk staff were extremely helpful and polite. They helped teach us some Thai phrases and helped us get to the Chatuchak Weekend Market. They also helped orchestrate phone calls to get us to our next destination.

Our second time staying here. staff helped getting our heavy suitcase upstairs as there is no lift. Scheduled airport drop off is free of charge and takes the stress off getting to airport on time. Our go to place if landing at DMK from this point on. Note that there is cheap A/C bus to downtown or Suvarnabhumi Intl airport.

Also there’s a local Thai restaurant across the street which is amazing!! Totally good food.    The taxi to the hostel was 110baht. The free shuttle ride to the airport the next day was awesome. They ask you at check in what time your flight is and what time you want to leave. Our shuttle driver was on his phone the whole time, but it was quick and it’s fine.

However, the soundproofing is nonexistent. The street noise is absolutely horrible, and we were also lucky to have drunk and cheerful neighbours. No sleep whatsoever. There is also no lift, and the better rooms are located on the upper floor. Free shuttle taxi to the airport is a plus, so is the simple, but freshly prepared breakfast. Overall, I'd give it a miss next time.","HOPPERS PLACE DONMUANG HOSTEL $16 ($̶2̶2̶) - Prices & Lodge Reviews - Bangkok, Thailand - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=846x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=13.915066,100.585876&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|13.915066,100.585876|13.915066,100.585876&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|13.908302,100.578300|13.921525,100.585388|13.920180,100.593430|13.918608,100.578445|13.913690,100.588791|13.913260,100.582520|13.914580,100.587173|13.913280,100.589951|13.919930,100.584991&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|13.912915,100.593147|13.916922,100.583923|13.911144,100.591629|13.912020,100.596069|13.911118,100.589676|13.912020,100.596069|13.914085,100.587784|13.911259,100.592789&signature=pp3J_dW9ofmRZD_b5a-pbOvWDkA="

The staff welcomed us when we were there, even though it is past midnight. Space was big, shower was hot, aircon was working well. No complains for the price. Though there isn't any breakfast shop nearby, we ordered from the hotel. Price was 50-70 baht.","HOPPERS PLACE DONMUANG HOSTEL $16 ($̶2̶2̶) - Prices & Lodge Reviews - Bangkok, Thailand - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=846x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=13.915066,100.585876&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|13.915066,100.585876|13.915066,100.585876&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|13.908302,100.578300|13.921525,100.585388|13.920180,100.593430|13.918608,100.578445|13.913690,100.588791|13.913260,100.582520|13.914580,100.587173|13.913280,100.589951|13.919930,100.584991&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|13.912915,100.593147|13.916922,100.583923|13.911144,100.591629|13.912020,100.596069|13.911118,100.589676|13.912020,100.596069|13.914085,100.587784|13.911259,100.592789&signature=pp3J_dW9ofmRZD_b5a-pbOvWDkA="
MasalaBoxTravel wrote a review Aug 2017,50,Awesome place and very friendly staff,"We stayed here for a night close to the airport. We had taken a private room. The staff were very friendly. We wanted to proceed to Khao yai and they took all the pain to find possible routes. If you want to catch a train to ayutthaya or north, this is place to stay since it is close to the station next to airport. breakfast was good. The room was also spacious enough for two.
