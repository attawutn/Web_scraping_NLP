I was shocked!!!,Jan 2022 • Solo,"To reach this amazing place, you have to take a ferry ride from Sathorn Pier (easily accessible via BTS Saphan Taksin Station).

The ferry ride costs 30 Baht and you will be dropped off at Wat Arun while the entrance fee for foreign tourists is 100 Baht. Thai locals do not need to pay.

I was shookt by how beautiful and majestic this place is. The place is unlike others that I have seen before. It looks like the ones you see in the movies 👏🏼👏🏼

It has huge area where you can roam around and even enter temples where you can see massive Buddha structures

I was shocked!!!,Jan 2022 • Solo,"To reach this amazing place, you have to take a ferry ride from Sathorn Pier (easily accessible via BTS Saphan Taksin Station).

I was shookt by how beautiful and majestic this place is. The place is unlike others that I have seen before. It looks like the ones you see in the movies 👏🏼👏🏼

"An extraordinary temple, different in style.",Oct 2020,"Wat Arun is located west bank of Chao Phraya river. You can easily see it from the east side (Wat Phra Kaew and Wat Pho are on the east side)

An extraordinary temple because of its style and well-decorated huge spire. The design is quite different from other temples. A colorfully decorated spire rises over 70 meters high standing by the riverside.

Besides the name of the temple, the most beautiful moment is the sunset view. Watching the spire at sunset on the other side of the river is one of the best views you can have in Bangkok.

A must-see in Bangkok,Nov 2020 • Couples,"Wat Arun or “Temple of the Dawn” got its name from the Hindu God Aruna, who is often depicted with shimmering light and rays of sun.

Beautiful temple. - Great for all influencers and photo-buffs.,Jul 2020,"The temple made a profound impact - strangely so - the millions of mosaic tiles perhaps, the hundreds of stairs going everywhere - the small number of tourists ( Thailand still with locked international borders at this time) - Everything in white -
The heat and reflection of the tiles - the shear scale of this temple -
All made for a tremendous exploring experience.
Only 100THB entrance fees - I timed it to be there late afternoon to catch the sun on the western side of the temple for more photo opportunities with the clear light - It was completely worth my while. ( and money well spent)

Stunning by day and by night,Jul 2020,"Wat Arun, is a 'must see' for anyone visiting Bangkok. My wife and I visited as part of an ""Introduction to Bangkok"" Tour, operated by Exo Travel Thailand. We pre-booked this with our Travel Agent, Trailfinders, prior to leaving the UK and that was worth doing. Our guide picked us up at our hotel and took us around the city, using various modes of transport, and visiting all of the most important sightseeing places. His knowledge of every place visited was invaluable, and saved us having to stop regularly to read up on the history of each place.

Although the central Prang is stunning, and the main feature in Wat Arun, there are other parts worth seeing. such as the main Chapel and the Ordination Hall. Wat Arun is normally visited during daylight hours, it is worth returning at night, if only to take photos when it is lit up. My wife and I were able to do that, as we booked a second tour, also with Exo, that included 'Bangkok by Night' and a riverside dinner. This gave us the chance to take photos in both daylight and nighttime and I will upload photos of both.

Such intricate details,Jul 2019,"In Thai the word Wat translates to temple and Arun means dawn. Thus this temple is known in English as the Temple of Dawn. This is a very popular attraction for many tourists along with the Grand Palace which is located directly across the river from Wat Arun by downtown Bangkok. To get to Wat Arun you will need to board a ferry to take you across the river. The easiest way to get to one would be to board the Bangkok Transit System (BTS) and get off on the Saphan Taksin ferry stop. From there it is around 25 minutes via boat to Wat Arun with some stops along the way. There will be signs at the dock listing tourist boats but beware that many will try to overcharge. For two individuals you shouldn’t pay more than 100 THB one way. If you choose to board at a different location they may charge upwards of 350 THB per person in locations near the Grand Palace. If you are near there we suggest walking down 10 minutes to the Tha Thien ferry station and pay 4 THB per person instead. Once you arrive you will purchase an entry ticket for 50 THB and if you are not dressed properly they will allow you to rent a sarong for 20 THB with a 100 THB refundable deposit. Generally you should wear long pants and avoid showing open shoulders but they can be lenient at times. Once inside you are free to roam around but there will be security there who will warn you if you are doing something you aren’t supposed to. This is mainly to protect the temple as many people tend to climb on the structures to get a good picture. We highly advise visiting here especially If you are torn between this and the Grand Palace.

Beautiful Ceramic tiled Temple,Dec 2019,"We took a grab ride to Wat Arun which was a bad decision. Normally I love grab rides but the ferry was so close and would have been a quicker option.

We arrived at Wat Arun around 2pm. Bought our tickets which were 50BAHT each. One of the cheaper entrance fees you will see while in Bangkok. Remember to dress respectfully or you can be denied entry. Knees and shoulders must be covered.

The temple is made out of ceramic titles and are very beautiful to see up close or from a distance. This temple is large but all the same. It was really cool. You can not go in the temple or the towers but you can walk about on top.

The temple of Dawn was believe to be built during the Ayutthara era. Which is incredible that it still looks so amazing.

There was a lot of people and a lot of people were expecting the perfect picture which means they stood in one spot for a long period of time. Some of the spots when you are walking around on the temple are very narrow so someone trying to get there hair right with there ""photographer"" were annoying and in the way. If you need the perfect picture try being polite and allow people to pass. We spent about an hour visiting the grounds.

We took the boat ride back which took no more then 5 mins. to get across and leaves about every 10 mins. So not much wait time in-between. There was some booths to get something to eat or drink close buy or buy some elephant pants if you were not covered up to enter.

First Rays of the Sun!,Apr 2019,"Wat Arun is a Buddhist temple in Bangkok (west bank of the Chao Phraya River). The Temple of the Dawn towering over the Chao Phraya River is one of Bangkok’s most visually striking landmarks and also one of Thailand’s top attractions. The temple was built in 17th century in the era of the Ayutthaya Kingdom. The temple’s name has taken from the Hindu god “Aruna”.
The temple’s central prang stands 79 meters tall and is decorated with tiny pieces of colored glittery glass. The first rays of the morning sun in Bangkok appear on the surface of the temple vividly.
If you don’t want to be stuck in the crowd and you want to take full pleasure of the sunrise in the temple go there as soon as possible. You must wear respectable clothes for entering the holy temple, otherwise you have to pay money to borrow suitable clothes from the temple’s entrance.
Wat Arun can be easily accessed through the Chao Phraya River by taxi boats which travel across the river. If you take a longtail boat tour for visiting Bangkok, you can see both Wat Arun and Bangkok’s other top attractions such as Chinatown, Wat Phra Kaew, Grand Palace and the Wat Pho, as you cruising the Chao Phraya River.

Highly recommended,Mar 2020 • Couples,So beautiful. Initially not that interested but so glad I made the trip. We got suckered into a private boat tour from a tour company that a tuktuk driver took as to. Managed to barter to a third of the price and glad we did.

Great place - go by ferry from the Grand Palace,Feb 2020 • Couples,"Wat Arun

Temple, temple and more temples. It’s what you come to Thailand for & this one is just as beautiful as the rest.

To get there the tourist boat stops outside of there is a little ferry boat (4 baht per person) which shuttles people from one side of the river to the other.

We went later on in the day about 1600 and it was really nice to wander round. There isn’t anywhere to go inside but you can climb onto it and walk all the way round. It didn’t take us very long at all to take some photos and get round it.

We would definitely recommend coming back at night as you can get a cracking views and it’s lit up beautifully. The little restaurants and bars on the opposite side of the river to it are some of the best places to see it from.

It’s definitely one to see but if you are short on time you can see it from the river or from the other side you wouldn’t necessarily be missing out but not stopping and climbing onto it.",Temple Of Dawn (Wat Arun) (Bangkok),"https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.attraction_review&zoom=15&size=416x722&scale=2&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=13.743687,100.488945&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Ffusion_map%2Fv2%2Fattractions-standard.png|scale:2|13.746575,100.492729|13.749965,100.491257|13.751205,100.492577|13.744119,100.494133&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Ffusion_map%2Fv2%2Fattractions-active-anchor.png|scale:2|13.743687,100.488945&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Ffusion_map%2Fv2%2Frestaurants-standard.png|scale:2|13.745692,100.491364|13.745728,100.491364|13.746208,100.491226|13.744853,100.491196|13.745675,100.491333&map_id=c01884c8146ad115&signature=HtOKN9Ju4QjR-bdCGOLXuzF3aWQ="
A must do if in Bangkok,Feb 2020 • Couples,"We visited here after walking for about 20 mins from Kao San area and getting the ferry across, which is cheap.
Entry to Wat Arun is 50 Baht at time of writing, but I think this is going up to 100 Baht during 2020.
It is much quieter than the Grand Palace and it takes around 30 mins to walk around completely.
We did it during the day at around 9:30am.
Architecturally it is absolutely fantastic to see, and some of the paintings of various stones and art work really is brilliant.
I’m sure this place means a lot to some people who we saw praying. We didn’t obviously feel the same appreciation probably because we aren’t religious, however we could certainly appreciate others’ love for Wat Arun.

Icon of Thailand; My Favorite Temple,Mar 2019,"Prominently located on the Chao Phraya River, with its image on the reverse of the 10 Baht coin, this is my favorite temple in Thailand. Referred to as the Temple of Dawn, both sunrise and sunset plays beautifully off the light colored surface. Following the fall of Ayutthaya in 1768, King Taksin felt that this would be the perfect location for the new capital upon encountering the old temple ""Wat Magog"". He renamed it ""Wat Jaeng"" (Temple of Dawn); which King Rama IV renamed Wat Arunratchawararam; now simply: ""Wat Arun"". The Emerald Buddha was housed here until both the capital and the Emerald Buddha were later relocated to the far safer Rattanakosin Island, directly across the river. The spires (prang) were added in the early 19th century. There are several buildings to tour here with exquisite tiles and gold details, but the main ""Wat"" does require a small fee. This is a Buddhist Temple, so observe the dress code with men in long pants and shirts with sleeves. Women should have their shoulders covered, as well as their knees. There are numerous shopping stalls in the area for clothing and gifts, as well as places to grab a snack or refreshment. Arrive early to beat the crowds. The grounds are lovely to explore, or you could even rent a traditional Thai outfit for a photograph before one of the buildings. Easy to access by river ferry from Rattanakosin (Old City), or by public river boat.

Dawn Temple but best in the evening,Feb 2020,"We went there by car. Then took the ferry. About 4 Baht per head. The entrance to the ferry looks a bit shady or dodgy but it isn't really. Just not properly signposted or official looking enough. Initially thought it was a diversion scam. The ferry is NOT over loaded...and waiting time,even if you fail to catch it, is only a few minutes...there are small souvenir stalls here so even waiting is a pleasure. The ferry-ride is just about 2 minutes or so...over before it really begins.
Totally speechless at first sight of the Temple complex. Exquisite is what comes to mind. Lovely lawns. Small souvenir and refreshment stalls too.
Apparently they used a million ceramic tiles from a Chinese shipwreck to decorate the facade. These were deftly incorporated into flowers and all! And when the sunlight hits it...the glitter is marvelous.
I would advise visitors to wear sensible shoes. And clothes that reflect your respect for the local culture and value system. . I wore a salwar kameez ...a saree would have been fine too...but was saddened to see that many people were not clad appropriately to visit a temple.
In the evening we went to a restaurant cum bar on the other side of the river to photograph the temple when it was all lit up. Against the fading light and colourful dusk sky with the illuminated boats on the river, the temple presented an unforgettable new look.

Magical,Feb 2020,"Like most other temples in Thailand, please dress appropriately with long pants and tops that cover your shoulders! If you do not, they will refuse your entrance into the temple. However, there are many shops at the ferry dock and before the temple grounds in case you forget. However, I think it's always better to be prepared!

After a short walk from the Grand Palace (around 15-20 minutes), you take a ferry to the temple. Ferry prices are around 4 THB/person. This ferry ride takes no longer than 5-10 minutes. At the temple, entrance fees are 100 THB per person (but I read a sign that stated the fee will be increased to 200 THB per person on June 2020).

Once you go in, it is an absolutely magical experience. The architecture is amazing. Visitors are able to climb up to the lower portion of the wat to see the architecture up close. However, be careful! The steps are very steep. I suggest going as early as possible to avoid the baking sun and crowds as much as possible.

There are restriction for women , Surprisingly not men , women not allowed if they wear short dresses, But the options are costly too , you need to buy or rent clothes near by
There are opportunistic vendours everywhere ( Money transaction, Private boating)
Apart from the Thai people who are great in their hospitality , this is very unfortunate experience of mine

1/ use the hop on-out boat service, Don't hire or book private trip , ( they come with stories of , will show you five place for certain amount of money).

It possible to see the temple on the approach but once you get there it’s so much bigger than I expected. Ladies be warn you will not be able enter without your arms and legs covered.

They are currently exhibiting The Buddha which highlights the misuses of commercialism relating to Buddha in the western world and are asking visitors to sign postcards which will be forward to the suppliers of these goods to try to stop this trading.

"Wat Arun, The Temple of Dawn",Jan 2020,"This is 4th time to step foot on one of the world's most beautiful temples set on the bank of the mighty Chao Praya River.

From here you could take several types of boat but if you're a tourist the most practical way is to take the Chao Praya tourist boat for just 200 Baht, they can take you to different famous landmarks in the Chao Praya river including this beautiful temple. The main feature of the temple is its central tower, Khmer style prang standing about 85 m. It is surrounded by 4 smaller prangs. Made of Porcelain from China, glasses and seashells radiating vibrant white color specially during the day. Khon Guardians also are intricately carved like holding the layers of the temple. Unlike other temples in Thailand, this is a unique design. Ticket for the temple is around 50 baht and it is not too big. Strict dress code is implemented since this is an active Buddhist temple and a Holy ground. It will take you about an hour including your beautiful photos and videos to visit and marvel at the temple itself. The temple has many layers but we've been only up to the 2nd one. Please be mindful the steps are a bit small and steep typical of Khmer architecture. For persons with disability they may not be able to go to the 2nd platform. You can even go further up if you would like to be on the top. Beside the temple is the equally beautiful Ordination hall which has a Buddha statue inside designed by King Rama II. And surrounding the temple is its beautiful park with the monument of King Rama II and it is also a perfect spot to take a panoramic and landmark shot from the base of the temple. Opposite side of the temple across the river there's a boat that could take you to Wat Pho, Temple of Reclining Buddha (separate review). There are many restaurants, cafe and hotels opposite the temple with the grandest view of it. I personally tried eating at Sala Arun with an impeccable view of the temple and it is one of the best moments I had here in Bangkok - such beautiful and relaxing atmosphere indeed.",Temple Of Dawn (Wat Arun) (Bangkok),"https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.attraction_review&zoom=15&size=416x722&scale=2&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=13.743687,100.488945&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Ffusion_map%2Fv2%2Fattractions-standard.png|scale:2|13.746575,100.492729|13.749965,100.491257|13.751205,100.492577|13.744119,100.494133&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Ffusion_map%2Fv2%2Fattractions-active-anchor.png|scale:2|13.743687,100.488945&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Ffusion_map%2Fv2%2Frestaurants-standard.png|scale:2|13.745692,100.491364|13.745728,100.491364|13.746208,100.491226|13.744853,100.491196|13.745675,100.491333&map_id=c01884c8146ad115&signature=HtOKN9Ju4QjR-bdCGOLXuzF3aWQ="

A well maintained and extraordinary place,Nov 2019,"I visited here with my wife and in-laws during an off-season. I was very impressed by the stunning workmanship and vivid colors of the pyramids. Despite being off-season a graduation was being celebrated there so there were crowds to deal with, but you could still have good views of the property since much was elevated. There wasn't anything inside that we saw to explore - all features were outside and directly exposed to sun and weather. It was quite warm for us so I expect summers to be nearly unbearable at this site.

Finding a ticket office was a challenge, and the lines for water taxis across the river to Wat Pho greatly interfered with getting on or off them in the morning when we were there. There did not appear to be any special behavior rules at this site.

Beautiful with Reasonable Crowds,Jan 2020,"Despite our high season (early January) visit we had a reasonable tour of the temple proper, an adjacent shrine, some time to hydrate and a bit of trinket shopping in one hour.

The second level is reached by a number of wide and steep (but not hideously so) staircases. There are no railings but there are ledges at each side you can use if necessary for some balance. The walkway around is narrow but people can pass and there are wide places at corners. The ""selfie"" crowd was reasonably subdued and I was able to get some very nice if very quickly composed photos with my SLR without causing disruption.

The entire temple is covered in decoration--much of it floral--made using mainly ordinary household objects of boldly decorated porcelain. Sadly there are many broken pieces on the two lowest levels but the upper levels (closed off) are nearly pristine.

My favorite Bangkok temple,Jan 2020 • Friends,"I liked Wat Arun the first time and it deserved a 2nd visit. With no glitz nor dazzling golden adornments, the Temple of Dawn distinguishes itself with its tall elegant structures, and pastel tones. Old multi coloured porcelain crockery were used to embellish its exterior, a bit reminiscent of Gaudi’s broken tile embellishments in Park Guell.
As it takes about 35 by car to get there from town, the crowds are thinner, a plus point. We spent a few hours at Icon Siam mall, 15 minutes away, so that we could be at Wat Arun for sunset. The temple closes at 6pm.

Iconic Temple by the Chao Phraya River,May 2019,"My Thai hosts took me on a trip down the Chao Phraya River by river taxi - very cheap, if you can distinguish them from the more expensive, tourist boats.

It was mighty hot when we were there - over 40%, and the Sunday crowds were searching for shade, as were we! The steps can be pretty steep, and the sun reflects brightly off the white and brightly painted glazed walls of the temple.

I was shocked!!!,Jan 2022 • Solo,"To reach this amazing place, you have to take a ferry ride from Sathorn Pier (easily accessible via BTS Saphan Taksin Station).

I was shookt by how beautiful and majestic this place is. The place is unlike others that I have seen before. It looks like the ones you see in the movies 👏🏼👏🏼

"An extraordinary temple, different in style.",Oct 2020,"Wat Arun is located west bank of Chao Phraya river. You can easily see it from the east side (Wat Phra Kaew and Wat Pho are on the east side)

If you come from Wat Phra Kaew, you can take a riverboat from Tha Tian pier to Wat Arun pier. The ticket is only 4 baht!!!

An extraordinary temple because of its style and well-decorated huge spire. The design is quite different from other temples. A colorfully decorated spire rises over 70 meters high standing by the riverside.

Besides the name of the temple, the most beautiful moment is the sunset view. Watching the spire at sunset on the other side of the river is one of the best views you can have in Bangkok.

Beautiful temple. - Great for all influencers and photo-buffs.,Jul 2020,"The temple made a profound impact - strangely so - the millions of mosaic tiles perhaps, the hundreds of stairs going everywhere - the small number of tourists ( Thailand still with locked international borders at this time) - Everything in white -
The heat and reflection of the tiles - the shear scale of this temple -
All made for a tremendous exploring experience.
Only 100THB entrance fees - I timed it to be there late afternoon to catch the sun on the western side of the temple for more photo opportunities with the clear light - It was completely worth my while. ( and money well spent)

Stunning by day and by night,Jul 2020,"Wat Arun, is a 'must see' for anyone visiting Bangkok. My wife and I visited as part of an ""Introduction to Bangkok"" Tour, operated by Exo Travel Thailand. We pre-booked this with our Travel Agent, Trailfinders, prior to leaving the UK and that was worth doing. Our guide picked us up at our hotel and took us around the city, using various modes of transport, and visiting all of the most important sightseeing places. His knowledge of every place visited was invaluable, and saved us having to stop regularly to read up on the history of each place.

Although the central Prang is stunning, and the main feature in Wat Arun, there are other parts worth seeing. such as the main Chapel and the Ordination Hall. Wat Arun is normally visited during daylight hours, it is worth returning at night, if only to take photos when it is lit up. My wife and I were able to do that, as we booked a second tour, also with Exo, that included 'Bangkok by Night' and a riverside dinner. This gave us the chance to take photos in both daylight and nighttime and I will upload photos of both.

This is why going with a knowledgeable guide is such an advantage, as the names and history of each part are explained to you, saving invaluable time if you wish to visit other popular sights on the same day.",Temple Of Dawn (Wat Arun) (Bangkok),"https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.attraction_review&zoom=15&size=416x722&scale=2&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=13.743687,100.488945&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Ffusion_map%2Fv2%2Fattractions-standard.png|scale:2|13.746575,100.492729|13.749965,100.491257|13.751205,100.492577|13.744119,100.494133&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Ffusion_map%2Fv2%2Fattractions-active-anchor.png|scale:2|13.743687,100.488945&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Ffusion_map%2Fv2%2Frestaurants-standard.png|scale:2|13.745692,100.491364|13.745728,100.491364|13.746208,100.491226|13.744853,100.491196|13.745675,100.491333&map_id=c01884c8146ad115&signature=HtOKN9Ju4QjR-bdCGOLXuzF3aWQ="

To get to Wat Arun you will need to board a ferry to take you across the river. The easiest way to get to one would be to board the Bangkok Transit System (BTS) and get off on the Saphan Taksin ferry stop. From there it is around 25 minutes via boat to Wat Arun with some stops along the way. There will be signs at the dock listing tourist boats but beware that many will try to overcharge. For two individuals you shouldn’t pay more than 100 THB one way. If you choose to board at a different location they may charge upwards of 350 THB per person in locations near the Grand Palace. If you are near there we suggest walking down 10 minutes to the Tha Thien ferry station and pay 4 THB per person instead. Once you arrive you will purchase an entry ticket for 50 THB and if you are not dressed properly they will allow you to rent a sarong for 20 THB with a 100 THB refundable deposit. Generally you should wear long pants and avoid showing open shoulders but they can be lenient at times. Once inside you are free to roam around but there will be security there who will warn you if you are doing something you aren’t supposed to. This is mainly to protect the temple as many people tend to climb on the structures to get a good picture. We highly advise visiting here especially If you are torn between this and the Grand Palace.

Beautiful Ceramic tiled Temple,Dec 2019,"We took a grab ride to Wat Arun which was a bad decision. Normally I love grab rides but the ferry was so close and would have been a quicker option.

We arrived at Wat Arun around 2pm. Bought our tickets which were 50BAHT each. One of the cheaper entrance fees you will see while in Bangkok. Remember to dress respectfully or you can be denied entry. Knees and shoulders must be covered.

The temple is made out of ceramic titles and are very beautiful to see up close or from a distance. This temple is large but all the same. It was really cool. You can not go in the temple or the towers but you can walk about on top.

The temple of Dawn was believe to be built during the Ayutthara era. Which is incredible that it still looks so amazing.

There was a lot of people and a lot of people were expecting the perfect picture which means they stood in one spot for a long period of time. Some of the spots when you are walking around on the temple are very narrow so someone trying to get there hair right with there ""photographer"" were annoying and in the way. If you need the perfect picture try being polite and allow people to pass. We spent about an hour visiting the grounds.

We took the boat ride back which took no more then 5 mins. to get across and leaves about every 10 mins. So not much wait time in-between. There was some booths to get something to eat or drink close buy or buy some elephant pants if you were not covered up to enter.

First Rays of the Sun!,Apr 2019,"Wat Arun is a Buddhist temple in Bangkok (west bank of the Chao Phraya River). The Temple of the Dawn towering over the Chao Phraya River is one of Bangkok’s most visually striking landmarks and also one of Thailand’s top attractions. The temple was built in 17th century in the era of the Ayutthaya Kingdom. The temple’s name has taken from the Hindu god “Aruna”.
The temple’s central prang stands 79 meters tall and is decorated with tiny pieces of colored glittery glass. The first rays of the morning sun in Bangkok appear on the surface of the temple vividly.
If you don’t want to be stuck in the crowd and you want to take full pleasure of the sunrise in the temple go there as soon as possible. You must wear respectable clothes for entering the holy temple, otherwise you have to pay money to borrow suitable clothes from the temple’s entrance.
Wat Arun can be easily accessed through the Chao Phraya River by taxi boats which travel across the river. If you take a longtail boat tour for visiting Bangkok, you can see both Wat Arun and Bangkok’s other top attractions such as Chinatown, Wat Phra Kaew, Grand Palace and the Wat Pho, as you cruising the Chao Phraya River.
