      "50 Accommodation Stayed here again. Great place, not far from the main places. Yet it is a quiet street.    Walking distance to night life not far from the beach.    Great room with a balcony over looking the road outside. Comfortable bed and cable TV. And a bonus, as far as I am concerned is the ceiling fan. Love it StanM3 wrote a review Mar 2021\n",
      "40 Accommodation Good location. Not bad interior, big spacious rooms, cleaner was brilliant and done sn excellant job.  Would definately stay again.    Only down side was the wifi. Couldn't get a connection, even with getting all the passwords. Must have been 7 or 8 different connections. Not one worked.  Apart from the occasdional smell if cigarette smoke for one of tge other rooms. It was ok StanM3 wrote a review Feb 2019\n",
      "30 great location the le travalgar has two kinds of rooms the larger rooms overlooking the road and the smaller rooms on the side of the building .the smaller rooms can be a bit shabby and if you are a non smoker its not so good because smoke can travel through the bathroom vent into your room. It would be better to pay the extra and stay in the rooms with the balcony .The staff were generally good and helpful.. rhorner8712 wrote a review Jul 2017\n",
      "40 Great Stay I stayed at the Trafalgar Guest house for 29 nights from 2nd Jan to 31st Jan 2016. I’ve travelled to Pattaya for the past 13 years and I can truly say that this is probably one of the best places I’ve stayed. The room I stayed in was one with a balcony overlooking Soi Lenkky, the room was a good size with a large comfortable bed. The room was cleaned every day with clean towels supplied and the fridge stocked with bottled water. The staff were very friendly and helpful and always greeted me with a smile. I gave my laundry to the cleaning lady who took it away and the next day it was all washed and ironed and delivered back to my room for 120 baht(£2.40). I had a problem with my air-con one night and reported it the next morning and within an hour the engineer had been and fixed it without any issues. The Trafalgar is guest friendly and has a discreet side entrance; the rooms also have a electric safe which is always handy. Check out time was 12noon but my taxi wasn’t picking me up until 22.00pm the owner let me keep the room until i was picked up at no extra charge. Had a fantastic time here and will for sure stay here again...Also had great WiFi    Water pressure in the shower wasn't the best but it was no big deal Matt W wrote a review Feb 2016\n"

Will come back again.Special thanks to Khun Boy, Khun Otto, Khun Nisa and Khun Tina.  飯店的服務很好，海景無敵，早餐是點餐+自助式，選擇頗多，餐點也很精緻，而且Khun Boy還特別提到日落及最佳拍照時間，所以拍的照片都特別漂亮。如果有機會，一定會再回來住宿。特別感謝Khun Boy, Khun Otto, Khun Nisa和 Khun Tina的服務與照顧。 yuyunz wrote a review Apr 2022\n",
      "50 Wonderful stay, good location and great staffs In my opinion, The Monttra is the best hotel in Pattaya. Everything at Monttra are PERFECT! This place is very nice, quiet and peaceful. You can take a deep breath, seeing ocean via the door, taking the wonderful pics at the restaurant and especially the landmarks of the hotel in front of the pool. The nature life at the resort is incredible.    Staffs are very helpful and full of service mind.  All breakfasts are limited choices but good quality. All staff teams are very nice. Special Thank you to Khun Nisa for the assistance during check-in and our stay and Khun Boy for storytelling of the Monttra history. The lovely staff was beyond amazing as they catered to every need with a big smile. We were more than impressed with the service at The Monttra.    The room have beautiful views of the trees and landscape with ocean view. We were stayed this resort last week for 2 nights and we came back again in two weeks. The room is clean and comfortable.    We would love to go back The Monttra for the future and we recommend people to stay here.  Thanks The Montta our holiday! Panumas N. wrote a review Apr 2022\n",
      "50 Excellent service and peaceful atmosphere When we had arrived the hotel, they had ATK kit for the guests before checking-in. Formerly, we had reserved for garden suite room type, but the air conditioner was not working, thankfully the hotel changed and upgraded our room to sea breeze suite, and the air conditioner worked very well. All the staff are very polite and helpful. The atmosphere was so nice and peaceful like we stayed on an island. Breakfast was awesome. What impressed us the most was the service as we’d like to give 10/10. Puengzii V wrote a review Feb 2022\n",
      "50 Perfect place ! I have been to this place many times, but I never left them a review til this time.    I and my family planned to Pattaya for one day trip but the beach was crowded so I decided to find a good place for my little angel to play a sandcastle as I gave her a promise. This place is come up to my head.    The service here is amazing - they are very helpful and happy to make your stay a remarkable experience, you will definitely feel that !!. I am really thankful Khun Boy and Khun Bee for warm greeting and making our trip so wonderful.    The room is clean and comfy. The location is easy to find. The views is stunning - want to see everyday!! ImNathan wrote a review Feb 2022\n",

      "50 Recommended! Great service and nice location. I would rate 5 out of 5 for this place. I have been through many hotels in Thailand, The Monttra Pattaya impressed me a lot on their service. All the hotel staffs are really friendly and helpful. The location is great, surrounding by restaurants but the hotel itself is quite. It's a great place to relax and recharge yourself. Recommended!

      "30 A hidden gem in need of some polish before it can shine bright! We booked a canopy plunge pool and were assigned room no. 401. We did call the hotel to pre-inspect and have the room in order. We arrived at 15.10 and were requested to do the ATK test for Covid-19 prior to check-in. While waiting for the result, we were invited to have high tea which was in the package. We checked in the room at 5 and found the room was a nightmare. Cleanliness was not up to par and light bulb was broken. Furniture was worn out and sofa needs to be changed. Black spot (mold like) was found on the curtain. Plunge pool got no water when we arrived. The toilet was smelly without ventilation system so you need to hold your breath while you use it.    The strong points of this hotel are its location on the secluded beach, management and staff who are friendly and attentive. However, with such a price I paid, I would expect better as well as value for money. So, I would hesitate to recommend others to stay in canopy plunge pool. Bingbongo wrote a review Oct 2021\n",
      "50 Lovely Peaceful resort This small resort has a beautiful landscape.  Quiet and private. Near the famous restaurants such as The Sky gallery, The Chocolate factory and Three mermaids. We stay in 2 room type.  1. The Sea breeze room has a nice sea view. We love the view from this room.  2. The canopy plunge pool. The housekeeping drain the water out of the pool,clean it and fill new water in before we check in. It’s a good process in this pandemic time.  We can see the service mind of all staffs here. They try their best to offer anything we need. They solve some problems in the room (eg. The keycard problem and the sliding door problem) with quick respond.  There’re 8-10 Breakfast menu. You can choose one or more. All the menu look great and delicious.  We have a good time here. Wanlopski wrote a review Mar 2021\n",
      "50 Secluded oasis in Pattaya Located on a secluded promontory point in Pattaya you’ll find the delightful Monttra. The location is secluded and lush, with superb vistas of the gulf of Thailand. The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. The rooms are simple, modern and with a quite large bathroom/shower area (at least in the plunge pool room we had!). But the real gem of Monttra is Kiin - the on-site restaurant which serves some of the most delicious Thai food we’ve had during our three years in Thailand! The cooking at Kiin is truly outstanding. Monttra shares a small beach with the sailing club next door. It’s a perfectly serviceable beach for a dip in the ocean. But, if you’re looking for a hotel where you can have lazy afternoons on the beach, then this is not the place for you. During weekdays the sailing club is relatively quiet, so once you walk down the steps to the beach you can have it to yourself. But on the weekends the sailing club is fairly frenetic, so you will be dodging dinghies and catamarans to find your way across the sand. That said, the infinity pool is lovely and the views are wonderful! So I don’t think the beach situation should be a deal breaker as Monttra has so many other qualities to recommend it. Finally, my only suggestion is that the management invest in a greater supply of pool towels - for some inexplicable reason these were in short supply throughout our 3 day stay and that’s not good for a pool/beach hotel! Monttra is the perfect getaway for a few days and you won’t even realize you’re amidst the hustle and bustle of Pattaya in this quiet oasis! centurionBKK wrote a review Sep 2020\n",
      "50 Lovely and quiet resort This was our second visit to this small resort. Most has been said about it: very friendly reception, nice room with many amenities that are all complementary, small but lovely and shaded pool, quiet environment around the pool, great breakfast and snacks served in the afternoon. A nice place to unwind. Dick Z wrote a review Jun 2020\n",
      "50 Great service. Breakfast is amazing. We visitted the hotel during the end of the strict quarantine. The hotel was one of a fews that were open during such hard time. We enjoyed the beach, nature and atmosphere. We want to thank K. Bee specially for her hospitality and extra-ordinary service. Only one down side is that the sea water was very dirty in one afternoon. I asked the next-door hotel’s staffs (sailing club) why and they said its the drain water that the sailing club let out. Hope this can be improved. Not only this area, but the whole Pattaya. Unalome W. wrote a review Jun 2020\n",
      "50 Magical Well this was unexpected. We were staying close by and decided to have a little look at Monttra.    From the moment we set foot in the resort we were treated like Royalty....and with good reason it seems.....the chef here previously worked personally for the Princess of Thailand!    As I said, we just came in for a look but the staff headed by Operations Manager Bee made us feel so special we decided to come back for dinner that evening. Bee was delighted to hear this and so offered us a complementary upgrade to plunge pool room if we wanted to stay.....of course we did!!    I could go on and on about how special this place is....and the staff but let’s keep things brief.    Food....usual Thai fare....but with a special twist that can only come from a chef that has worked personally for royalty. The extra flavours and appearance turned basic dishes into amazing dishes!!    The rooms were lovely and spacious...with sea views!    The massage was the best we have both had in Thailand....that’s in 10 years of visits!!    Thank you Bee and staff for turning 10 minutes into a 24 hour 5 star VIP experience.    We cannot wait to come back! paulxs1 wrote a review Jan 2020\n",
      "50 A seemingly hidden gem! On my last day here I happened upon this wonderful hidden grove by the sea.  The staff are charming and the view ,from out under the trees to the sunset with the sound of the waves is magical.  The food is up with the best.  Thank you. Paul A wrote a review Jan 2020\n",
      "50 Flawless get away! I've stayed at the Monttra on October 2-3, 2019 with my partner. Since we arrived the staff welcoming us cheerfully and helpfully, they take care of us through the trip. Thank you so much, we appreciated.  - The atmosphere was fantastic with lots of trees, sea view and private beach.  - The room was excellent; clean, simple yet cozy.  - The restaurant, Kiin, was outstanding, they served authentic Thai food which made with fine ingredients. Must try!  Moreover, another guests were nice and polite. It's an exceptional trip, I'm glad I chose this place for my retreat weekend. See you again real soon ❤️ Pichsinie P wrote a review Nov 2019\n",
      "50 Wonderful relaxing Great location, looking across the bay of Pattaya, has a great little private beach, and a beautiful swimming pool. The Outdoor restaurant is very well catered for with great offerings durimng the course of the day. Andy D wrote a review Oct 2019\n",
      "40 True magic The hotel is situated on the south side of central Pattaya, directly on the coast. It is a bit hidden with lots of green. The reception is in a separate area. The staff is all young, enthusiastic, very friendly and ready to serve. The room was large and looked renovated. There is a coffee machine, there are free drinks and snacks and it has all the amenities. The area is green with spread out places to sit. There is a clove-shaped pool, not large, but to call it an oversized jacuzzi (as I read somewhere here) is unfair. At the far end it is deep enough and you can really swim. Twenty easy strokes from side to side. It does easily catch fallen leaves and it would be good to find it clean in the morning instead of late afternoon.  The restaurant provides for a large choice of mostly Thai dishes, but the westerner can also find something if desired. In the morning there is a very nice breakfast. An order of a number of choices off a menu and a buffet. More than enough. But for coffee: better in the room. This would all add up to 5 balls but for one significant annoyance. This place too has fallen for the misconception that people cannot withstand the absence of sound (also known as peace and quiet). So in the restaurant there is a sound. A mixture of computer generated beats with some tones, no melody and definetely not music by any definition. It is the kind of stuff you can get by gigabyte I think. And all this too loud.  This is a lovely quiet place to relax and unwind so spare me the noise. Fortunately in the evening we were the only guests and they turned it off, so we could hear what should be heard: the rustling of the waves. Dick Z wrote a review Sep 2019\n"

      "50 Perfect little hotel for a special family reunion We loved this hotel because it felt uniquely Thai, the (small) pool has a wow factor, we enjoyed our meals there, the menu is interesting and the staff went out of their way to give us a great holiday. Most importantly we loved being well away from the Pattaya crowds. It was so peaceful and relaxing.    I was happy with location although at the moment the entry into the hotel is a tad messy as they upgrade the drainage in the area. Our first impressions were of a pretty and unique garden location looking out to sea. The hotel was smaller than I expected but guests never seem to get on top of each other.    We really liked our upgraded bedroom, we looked through the garden to the sea. At one point we had no hot water but they were immediately onto this. The bathroom was lovely a huge bath and separate shower and really nice toiletries. WIFI worked well.    The kid's rooms were in the garden view block. I’m getting the impression that some aspects of The Monttra’s flooring need a renovation. They have gone for the polished concrete look which chips easily. This was particularly the case in one of the kid's rooms in the shower. But I hand it to them, I point it out and we are immediately offered new rooms.    The swimming pool is not for those wanting a big swim workout but is bigger when you are in it than it looks, and so beautiful looking out to sea. There are some small tiles missing, which need attending to. You should note there is no gym here.    The open-air dining room was always cool and breezy even in the height of an April Summer, with a beautiful view. The breakfast menu was incredible AND not only that, top marks for healthy options too. The only item on the entire menu that was not to our taste was the ham. I could suggest a better selection of herbal teas would be nice. We all remarked on how good the coffee was (and for coffee lovers, there is a Nespresso machine in every room)    The resort was running at high occupancy rates but it never felt crowded. Somehow it all worked. I was never in the pool with anyone other than our family, there was always a sun lounger. AND the other guests were lovely, everyone was very respectful of the peace and tranquillity of the hotel.    I had not fully appreciated the benefit of all that is included in the room rate, it made our stay good value: 15-minute trial massage in the garden gazebo was so lovely, we ended up booking four more massages, Complimentary daily Häagen-Dazs icecreams and wonderful afternoon nibbles from their creative chef. The free minibar stocked with things you would actually eat and drink including beer in our rooms. Buggy transport up the road to the local restaurants.    Having read that other Trip Advisor reports mentioned a drainage smell, we were on high alert for this. There was an intermittent bad smell from between the next door Sailing Club and the hotel on our first night. Whether the wind changed, or whether the new drainage has sorted it, but it was not an ongoing problem for us.    Thank you so much to Bee, Natty, Otto and everyone at The Montra Pattaya, I have high standards and I was keen to have everything just right and you nailed it. I love this resort and really hope that we can come back and spend more time with you again. Little Wandering Wren wrote a review May 2019\n",
      "30 Quiet little paradise away from the tourists Small resort: there are only 2 3 sea breeze suites, 4 larger suites and probably around 20 normal rooms  The resort is located far from hustle and bustle. There are a few restaurants and 7-11s around the corner. Resort is very nicely set under a canopy of trees which provides a nice shady environment from the hot sun, but overlooking the ocean. There are building works right behind the resort where high rises are built but when you are inside the resort, you will not notice (also no noise). Once you are in the ocean and you look towards the resort, the skyline becomes visible.  The resort has beach access with stairs to a small beach which is shared with the Royal Varuna Yachtclub, so no sun loungers on the beach, only sailing boats. During certain parts of the day, lost of boats are launched and you need to ensure not to swim in their way. However, the resort has sun loungers scattered around their pool in the garden, so no need for beach loungers in the hot sun  Because of the location next to the sailing club, you might have races happening in the weekend which provides a beautiful view, but also the sound of a horn very regular to announce the starting of a race    We stayed at a Seabreeze suite which is spacious and has nice seaviews - we had 201, the one 'furthest' away. I would suggest booking 203 as this one will give you more seaview.  Decoration is nicely done in grey and blue tones but you can already see humidity stains, paint peeling from walls, scratches everywhere, rust on the picnic basket with snacks and cutlery and plates.  Be mindful the bed is a mattress on a wooden plank, they added a mattress topper to make it a bit more comfy but it still is a very hard mattress. I super thick mattress topper would be better.    Open bathroom is very large but there is hardly any space to hand wet towels or your clothes. There is only a small clothes rack with a few clothes hangers  The wash basin does not have a mirror: there is a small standing mirror and a large one on the wall but shaving means you need to bend over to the small standing mirror to ensure you do not cut yourself.    The private terrace has 2 sunloungers (missing a table so you have to leave your stuff on the ground) and the cushions are covered in stains and droppings of an animal.    The resort has a lovely small infinity pool with amazing views. They serve drinks and food at the pool, interestingly in glasses and on ceramics.....Pool is missing a lot of tiles.  Pictures on the website of all the beanbags scattered around are not accurate - they are stored behind some shrubs and not in use. Everywhere there are little terraces in the garden with sun loungers but several are empty. Set up is really nice as you are always relaxing somewhere fairly private, at no time there will be strangers lying next to you    The restaurant has beautiful sea views. Breakfast is mainly a hot breakfast with eggs, pancakes & other Asian dishes, made to order. However, my scrambled eggs were made in same pan were all the bacon & sausages were prepared hence my eggs tasted like bacon. There is a small selection of fruit each day on the buffet with yoghurt (only sweetened), cornflakes, some cheese and salami, factory bread for toasting and jam. I would say breakfast is basic and not of high quality but it is okay since they do serve a decent Latte  As a very nice touch, each day they serve a plate of Thai style afternoon bites complimentary to their guest.    Minibar in room is free but mainly contains some Thai drinks. Some snacks in room as well like pringles and cookies. Nice gesture.  Nespresso machine in room is a great add-on.    Staff is super friendly and we will return next year because it is next to the sailing club and probably the only quiet place away from the tourist area Marikenv wrote a review May 2019\n",
      "40 Can’t say enough about this place. The private beach and gardens were amazing, secluded and quiet. Location was far enough away from Pattaya centre to feel you are away from the city but close enough to have easy access to great restaurants and shopping centres. Afternoon snack was a lovely touch.  Nice small private pool, needed a bit of a clean, lots of leaves because it is surrounded by large lush beautiful green tree’s.  Great for a romantic get away.

      "50 Oasis in a bustling city We stayed here for 9 days as competing in a sailing competition at the yacht club next door and chose the Monttra for our stay as it was the closest hotel. I had read the reviews so was expecting good service and food but what we received here far exceeded our expectations. The location - right on the sea with tastefully landscaped gardens and a small infinity pool was perfect but the staff are what made our stay so special - especially Otto with his warm welcome every morning for breakfast. There is nothing they won’t do for you - one night the bar had closed and a group of us wanted another drink so a staff member offered to go to the 7 eleven to get some beers. They have a golf buggy to run you up the road to the local shops, atm etc and if you need a taxi they have a hotel car available - complimentary if it is just a short drive. The afternoon teas were amazing - a savoury snack, dessert, fruit and Haagen dass ice cream - we always tried to get back from the sailing before 5pm so we didn’t miss out! The restaurant area is outdoor under a covered terrace surrounded by leafy plants so very cool to sit in with the sea breeze - we had dinner here one evening and it was fantastic. I would say this hotel is better suited for couples and adult groups than families. There are a couple of minor points I would make: 1. There is not enough storage in the rooms - just a hanging rail with a few hangers - no shelves or drawers however when I mentioned it to reception they provided a temporary set of drawers the same morning. I guess if you’re only here for the weekend it’s not an issue but we were here for 9 days as part of a 2 week holiday so had a lot of luggage. 2. The floor is concrete which had started to deteriorate and had obviously been repaired in places - we had another flaky patch but although this was repaired as soon as I mentioned it I would have expected this to be addressed before guests use the room. These minor issues however did not detract from a fantastic stay - could we have found somewhere cheaper? Yes, probably - but would we have left feeling like we were saying goodbye to family? Unlikely! crystaltips2017 wrote a review Mar 2019\n"

      "20 Over rated, Over priced, Over sold 4.5 stars and US$320 per night in Pattaya sets an expectation. The Monttra fails to live up to its impression of itself.    I write this as we relax in our uncleaned room at midday after the room cleaning people did not come when we went out for a walk despite hanging the huge wooden sign on the door outside for anyone that walk past to see    From the unswept verandah, to the old towels, to the poor room quality, to the loud aircon, to the inflexibility of the spa special offer, to the what will happen next, disappointing is the only word. One imagines a 4.5 star hotel has hot and cold water at the bathroom basin and a mirror on the wall to groom by. Not this one. Its the little things that count and there are many little things done badly to count.    If you can get a 3 star price to stay here, its OK. But anymore than $200 pn night is over charging. If I paid that I would accept all of the above without compliant and given an OK review. Value for money has 2 parts and I cant see the value for what I paid. Wayne wrote a review Feb 2019\n",
      "40 Family long week end The hotel is nice , the staff is excellent. I do like the simplicity of the room and the firm bed. The sun beds near the infinity pool with a view on the sea are great . I appreciated the complimentary afternoon snack, everyday different.  I do believe that being in Thailand they could make a better effort on the choice of fruit they offer in the morning. Every day is the cheapest and easiest choice of fruit, papaya, watermelon and pineapple. Every single day. .  Like in most of the hotels in Thailand the selection of fruit is so poor and I don’t understand why. There is such a big variety of fruit in this country: mangosteen ,dragon fruit , passion fruit , longan , rambutan , banana. Apples, pears, tangerine , mango. Simona001 wrote a review Feb 2019\n",
      "50 Wow Took a walk and found this hotel tucked behind the yacht club. The hotel looks great, very private with their own beach. Small, private and quaint. Away from the hustle and bustle but a 5 min walk to stores and restaurants.  We decided to have dinner and we were not disappointed. The food was excellent, the staff were wonderful.  A very pleasant surprise indeed.  Will go back. KellieWorldGames wrote a review Feb 2019\n",
      "10 Overpriced hotel fees! We booked a room with 2 kids 11 year old. 2 Kids 11 year old was for free. however in the room there are no sofas, no carpets and the it's ciment floor nowhere the kids can sleep. you need to require extra beds and they charge 50EU! per night for extra bed. they can only add one! they give a matelas more free of charge. it makes the room at about 200EU per night. there is nothing exceptional, room is small, swimming pool is really small, only one small restaurant for breakfast lunch and dinner. The main bed is so strong that you feel like sleeping on the floor! when you complain they add a softer matelas on the top....you would pay the hotel at 80EU per night it would be ok but not at 200EU.... there are much better hotel for this fee!

      "50 Fabulous Stayed here for 5 nights, lovely grounds, beautiful pool, gorgeous views, peaceful, quiet, small private beach which we spent every day on and there was never anybody else there! We grabbed a couple of huge beanbags and spent a few hours relaxing after breakfast. Breakfast was amazing all cooked to order plus a small buffet selection to choose from. The food and coffee were amazing. Staff were lovely, friendly, making sure you were comfortable and happy. Spacious room, modern, more storage for clothes is needed though. Great shower. Complimentary snacks and soft drinks in the room and a great coffee maker too. Complimentary afternoon bites served every day which we took advantage of as we just chilled and relaxed all day, only venturing out of an evening. Tucked away it’s very quiet here, you could walk about 15 mins to a small area of shops, bars and restaurants and the all important 7 eleven for essentials, but to venture further out you’ll need transport, we hired a moped to get about. You wouldn’t know you where in crazy Pattaya staying here. We came from another hotel to here and paid almost exactly the same price, this compared to the other is 5* LOVED IT newlydiate wrote a review Jan 2019\n",

Within walking distance from the nearby Chocolate Factory and the Sky Gallery Pattaya.    For couples, recommended to book the private villa with Jacuzzi (a squarish bath tub in the balcony) with an ocean view. Room rates are all- inclusive of in-room snacks and beverages, complimentary breakfast and afternoon tea.    For relaxation, must try the hotel spa - Jungle Gazebo which is a private spa escape for couples... wilsonhocw wrote a review Oct 2018\n",
      "30 Unique tucked away hotel We have a mixed reaction to this property as there are many really good points and some not so good. The staff are this property's biggest asset as all we encountered during our two day stay were outstanding and exceptionally helpful.  The breakfast was a pleasant treat as they not only have the standard international options they have a selection of set dishes that are really unique and interesting.  The pool is quite small and when even slightly busy was inadequate but in a lovely garden setting.  The meal we had at Breeze restaurant was OK but not anything exceptional and a bit expensive for it's quality.  The rooms are unique, we stayed in a garden view room on the first floor, the rooms are large and a combination of Thai style (doors don't fit) and a standard room, the toiletries are very good quality. The shower and toilet are in cubicles with glass doors off the main room which is interesting, the toilet cubicle is immediately adjacent to the bed so at night when one of you uses the WC the light blinds your partner. Now to where the property has seriously failed in one of the basic 3 needed for a hotel room THE BED it is like sleeping on a slab of concrete, we did ask after the first sleepless night if they had a softer mattress and they did try by putting a small foam topper on the mattress which did improve the situation very slightly, so unless you like an exceptionally hard mattress this property is not for you.  The location is nice, as far being on a beach and very quiet but to get a taxi to town is 200B and the best we could get for the return was 300b, each way is only a 5-8 min ride so on Thai standards very expensive. To sum up due to the bed and location this is a very expensive hotel. foantrip wrote a review Aug 2018\n",

I want to call ‘infinity pool’ is ‘infinity Jacuzzi’  Too small for swim.  Room service isn’t work after 21:30, Phone was engaged all the time, even if i stayed Saturday night.  When i stayed Thailand hotel almost staffs are so friendly but here is Not friendly. Just met few friendly staffs when i ate Breakfast.  Room is nice, but room key, inside lock system is too hard when opened or locked.  Breakfast quality also not good compared to their rates. Nothing special minibar.  Call car also high price.

      "50 Beautiful, cozy, peaceful, intimate - we'll be going back soon Tucked away in a cozy corner as part of the Varuna Yacht Club property, The Monttra is a little gem.  About 20 rooms dotted in the midst of lush tropical forest, bird call, and dappled sunlight, the resort gives you the joy of both a forest retreat, as well as a beach resort.    A little path leads you down to a tiny strip of beachfront, shared with the yacht club. The infinity pool overlooks the sea and you can soak in it all day, watching the boats and yachts go by. It's a sheer drop from the pool to the rocks below and the beach around it is fairly shallow, so you can enjoy the sea vessels without having to put up with the noise that usually goes with it. The pool is shaded by ancient trees so you can swim all day without burning up.    The rooms are contemporary chic, cleverly designed, and comfortable. The mini bar is well stocked, and get this - it's all free! And that's the thing with the Monttra - like the Cornucopia, it keeps giving. A stocked bar, snacks, chocolate dipped strawberries on the bed instead of a mere mint... I could keep going.    The breakfast buffet is small but adequate, with each item on the menu done beautifully, instead of a large, extended menu of low quality fillers. If you miss the 10 am deadline for breakfast at their open air restaurant breeze that overlooks the sea, you can have a set platter brought to your bed. From 2 pm to 5pm they have a serving of small bites likes tapas, again, free of charge. We mostly ate our meals out and saw the city, but the few breakfasts we ate at the hotel, were delicious, varied, and filling.    The massage room is a thatched hut and set in the middle of a nautilus-like spiral - you walk through walls of bamboo greens to the hut set in the heart of it. I didn't think I'd have the courage to strip off in an open hut, in the middle of a resort, and yet, it's so well concealed, that you need have no fear and it is a far lovelier experience than any air-conditioned room.    A special mention of the staff (Bobby in particular, is a star!) - they go above and beyond the call of duty to accommodate you. Need a cab at 2am? Sure, ma'am. An umbrella? Right away. I liked an item of decor that is a local handicraft, one they'd used around the resort, and asked where I could buy one. They promptly packed up a brand new piece from their extras and gave it to me.    As we got into our cab for the airport and I relaxed into the comfort of the seat, I mentioned to my husband that they'd spoilt us enough to last a year. He produced a little bag from the back of the seat saying that it wasn't over - they'd thoughtfully packed us a little picnic bag of sandwiches and water for the ride to the airport.    In short, it's a great place for honeymooning couples, or those on their second honeymoon, like us, but kids below 7-8 would probably be better off elsewhere. The toilet doors have no locks, there are certain sections that have steep drops to the ocean, past rocks. And there is no godawful mac and cheese type offering on the menu. If however, your kids are well behaved, quiet, and enjoy good food, this is as lovely a place for them as any adult. smritilamech wrote a review Sep 2017\n",
      "30 Cozy place A good hotel, small and it has own charming moments. The truth is the case when the photos are made or very professional or so improved that you will not recognize these places. The breakfast was not bad, the nature around is also picturesque, all overgrown with lianas and you are walking down the path into the depths as if in a jungle. The terrace was without a roof and all its own sun loungers and pool were constantly in twigs and leaves and in the rain. The cost is too high. Dinara K wrote a review Sep 2017\n",
      "40 Small place for a great hideaway weekend We spent 3 nights at the resort but didn't get to use the facilities much due to busy working schedule. Every staff member of the Monttra ensured our stay to be at it best once we at the resort, a stress free and good relaxing time. Breakfast menu and selection are at good quality especially when combining with the horizontal sea scape in the front. The free 15-min-massage is the best that we would be sorry if missed. The staff took extra mile to make sure we got to have these session by arranging time for our last minute prior to check out.    The only con side is the room should have more place to hang cloth and keep those dirty laundry.    The hotel is great but the staff member is the best!!!

Their complimentary of afternoon drink and snack were good taste, a free massage was very nice and breakfast also unforgettable. A beautiful and private location is an advantage so I was really enjoy and relax to stay here.

      "50 Best Thai Getaway We were blessed to spend our holidays in this hotel, everything was absolutely incredible. the rooms are beautiful and perfectly clean, the breakfast is very tasty and can be delivered to your room for the lazy ones. The swimming pool has an amazing view and is open to guests and kept clean 24/7. One thing that stands out the most however is the service, the hotel does everything possible to satisfy its clients, make them feel at home and comfortable. They helped me find the best hospital around and made an appointment with the dentist for me. One morning they made breakfast an hour earlier than it is supposed to be just to satisfy our hunger after a night out. A special Thank you to the Receptionist Jasmine, who really went out of her way to help me and did an amazing job, she really pushes the service of the hotel to the next level, should definitely be promoted to Manager, Thank you Jasmine, we had a great time in Monttra!

      "50 Secret hideaway in Pattaya A beautiful and peaceful location outside busy Pattaya, located next door to the Royal Varuna Yacht Club made it the perfect choice for our family as our son participated in the world championship regatta from the club. We enjoyed and loved the garden, the hotel and the beautiful small swimming pool with view to the sea and the yacht club Beach where the sailors launched the boats every day. The Monttra is a well kept secret and resort to those who prefer boutique hotels and minor hotels instead of huge resorts and aircon hotels . I used to backpack way back, and the Monttra reminded me of the many lovely familyrun bungalows I used to stay at - but in a luxury version of highest standards. We already miss the breakfast in the airy restaurant, the afternoon bites and the most beautiful garden with squirrels and birds. The Monttra offers different kind of massages but also free cooking class, yoga and monk ceremony. We found the place nice and very clean but the wifi was bad and the restaurant quite slow - but it only reminds you of slowing down and to relax. It is not a typical place to bring children, but you can easily do it, many did it. Vibse wrote a review Aug 2017\n",

      "50 Honeymoon heaven A fantastic location, just on the outskirts of the busy renowned Pattaya, that is mounded into the beauty of its original setting. The Monttra is surrounded by natural foliage and private beach. We were greeted with genuine Thai smiles and excellent English (great given our lack of Thai). A cool cloth and welcome drink of butterfly pea and ginger was a much needed delight after the 1.5hr taxi journey from Bangkok airport.  Breakfasts are á la carté (made to order from an unlimited impressive menu) alongside a selection of buffet items.  Afternoon bites - free - are a daily surprise (also unlimited) and a treat to the tastes buds!  The staff are personable, friendly yet un-intrusive. Their English is beyond expectations which made communications a breeze.  This was our honeymoon and every member of staff, including those we had not previously met, congratulated us and they all took that extra step to make it a special stay.  Daily surprises are part of the experience - I refuse to spoil that for you!  It is a small resort in an idyllic location, not expected to be possible in the city of Pattaya, and you are made to feel the only guest. There are additional extras - for example; in room dining, Buddhist monk blessings, free 15 minute massage in the hotel spa...to,name but a few.  From the moment,you wake, to the moment you go to sleep, the hotel and their fantastic staff (from reception, housekeeping, chef, maintenance) will make your stay more than you could have of expected.

Beautifull view on the sea, private beach and nice place surrounded by greenery. Hotel with limited rooms which make the experience like home. ALL the staff were perfect, really carefull, never experienced such good services in Thailand before. The restaurant was nice, breakfast good and original.  Highly recommend this place in Pattaya ! puff G wrote a review Jul 2017\n",
      "50 Excellence service& very beautiful resort. We visited the resort from6-8july 2017. It is one of the best place to be in Pattaya. The resort is so beautiful and quiet , you can really relax and enjoy a very good view of the sea all day long.  All the staffs are so caring, they really take care of you and make you feel so special. They looked into my friend's id card and it was her birthday a day before we check in , when we ordered dinner the staff told us that the meals was a complement from hotel and they come with a birthday cake singing happy birthday. Thank you so much to kun bobby, kun jusmine , kun bee (บี๋) and everyone there for your kindness.  The room we got was also one of the best view room ( sea breeze no.203) .  The breakfast here are also lots of variety and i love fresh fruits juice that you can take as much as you want. Afternoon snacks are really good too.  What more to say ^^. ...  What i love most about this place is an extremely good staffs and service .  I would recommened to everyone who wants peaceful relaxing holiday. You won't be disappointed.  I will visit again .

      "50 Once in a lifetime honeymoon, won't let you down We stay here for 3 days 2 night for our honeymoon after our wedding. We have a really memorable and great time here. I would say, it's the people here made our day! They are so much like our friends, everyday they talk to us and concerned about anything we need. We love them all and really appreciate their efforts making us feel special.    You will never get hungry in monttra!    Breakfast, you can have it any time. The order to cooked set are so delicious and and have some more if not enough. They have a few choice of food in buffet style(fruits, salads...etc.). While sitting in the breeze, wind blowing, bird singing, so relax.    In 2-5pm, they provide afternoon bites, which are good as well, especially the \"salads\" dishes. You can enjoy the buy 1 get 1 free cocktail together with the bites. The signature one are quite special in Thai style, spicy.    In room, minibar are free, including alcoholic drinks. And will be refilled daily (and are different).    In evening, a small dessert are served to you room.    Their special detox drink (a jar)could be provided anywhere anytime. And it taste nice!    The amenities are loccitant (love it), and the packing is recycled which are environmental friendly. The whole hotel are maintaining a natural atmosphere which make you feel like in nature.    And our romantic candle night dinner are the highlight of our trip. Originally we schedule the dinner in the first night, but the weather were so bad that it could no way to make it. So we changed to the 2nd night. We were sorry that we waste the staffs time for preparing.    On the 2nd day, they keep updated us the situation and the backup plan. We feel so excited about it. And we take their suggested time for the dinner so as to enjoy the sunset. The view is stunning, the set up is breathtaking, it is so romantic and nice.    They put two bean bed by the side for our chill time. We love it .    They provide a \"call bell\" for us in case we need any thing while we can enjoy a completely private time for 2.    The food are as good as usual and were in reasonable price. We enjoyed a 6hrs long dinner time and were so unforgettable.    Don't miss the welcome drink! And the pool! Small but great view, for those not good at swim like me, the pool is enough for swim. They provide a 15 mins free massage per guest per stay and it was so good that having it in sunbath on the cliff. Therapist are well trained that make you feel like it's 30 mins long!    Such a getaway here in monttra. Our room are clean and spacious.    If I have to think of anything they could make here even better, I would suggest them to provide bath salt for the bath tubes. Would be more enjoyable.    The location is not too far from the pattaya center(like walking street), we take uber to there around 70-80thb, 10 mins. They have golf car can send you to nearby (like chocolates factory) so even you don't have car, it's not a big problem I think.    Once again, worth for the room rate, more than worth actually. We completely relax during the stay. We believe that it's the staffs who are the most important part to make our stay special.    Thanks bee, Bobby and breeze manager(forgot to ask his name...), I miss you all and you guys are marvelous! ying pine i wrote a review Jul 2017\n"

      "50 Great hospitality of The Monttra Pattaya We put up a night in The Monttra Pattaya last weekend, i had been doing a lot of travelling for business and vacation, but The Monttra Pattaya offered the best hospitality experience. From the great services during check in, eat all you can snack in the room, to the customized breakfast selection, even offering free sandwiches when we checked out! Lovely workers in the hotel, not to mention the private beach in Pattaya and nice minimalist room decoration! We will definitely come back again! sean7447 wrote a review Jul 2017\n",
      "50 A great place to stay From a good welcome drink up to the depature a really good service from very friendly staff. A great place to stay in a calm, clean and very nice little park directly at the beach. Nice little pool and realy good drinks. Breakfast good with a great choice. We come again.

      "50 A must visit - everything was amazing This hotel is exceptional from start to finish - we arrived very late on our first night but reception staff were alert, friendly and helpful as they showed us to our room and the facilities. We awoke to breathtaking views, a great breakfast (there is a small buffet + a la carte all included) and a delightful three days of swimming in the pool & private beach, happy hour from 2-5 with a great afternoon tea (free) and then a lovely room service dinner. Upon departure we were provided with a gift pack with sandwiches and water for our journey (so unexpected). We booked the magical getaway deal that includes a list of perks that make this great value on top of all of the inclusions per standard so we were blown away. A great experience and will definitely visit again. JBS85 wrote a review Apr 2017\n",
      "40 Nice boutique hotel but the restaurant needs a makeover... If you are going to Pattaya I can recommend this hotel (however I cannot recommend Pattaya but thats beside the point..)    The positive:  - The Sea Breeze suite is spacious and beautifully decorated  - The all day breakfast is a great concept so you dont have to rush and can truly enjoy your holiday  - The complimentary afternoon snacks are a nice touch  - The hotel is set in a quiet location  - The massages are really good    The negative:  - The wifi requires re-log in all the time  - A new booking system is needed for secure payment!!  - The beach is small so it should be feasible to have it cleaned daily (this was not the case during our stay)  - The restaurant. I wish they would completely re-do the whole menu to have a few amazing thai dishes. We had everything from old bread to cold coffee to very oily dishes. Its such a shame that they try to do fusion food which results in poorly made thai food. We ordered the massaman curry which was described as a curry with beef tenderloin, mango sauce and mashed potatoes. The beef was in no way beef tenderloin, it was served with rice and it was so oily. We asked the waiter about it who explained that you cannot serve massaman with mashed potatoes (then stop putting it on the menu) and that the mango was instead chunks of potatoes  - In general its very difficult to locate a waiter at the restaurant... louiseskare wrote a review Mar 2017\n",
      "50 Overall Great Experience Went there for a week vacation with my boyfriend. Staff were all pleasant, friendly and sooooooo helpful. Their breakfast buffet and free afternoon buffet was so good. Just quite of a hassle to go to the nearest mall or convenience store but don't hesitate to ask the staff and they'll gladly send you a ride out.    PS. Please don't stain your bed. Its 900 baht extra. Sandy C wrote a review Mar 2017\n",

      "40 Beautiful boutique resort (+) The landscape and view, beautiful beach, many squirrels and birds at the pool. Helpful staff. Good breakfast.    (-) It's too tiny and there is not much activity, swimming pool is also little. Restaurant is serving food so slow for dinner. Restroom in the room is not convenient and I'm not sure about hygiene, the toilet is two meters away from the bed without proper door between them. Surrounding area is not cool.    Overall this resort worths the money but it's far from the best in Pattaya. I hardly think I would love to come back again ever. However we had nice experience in there. nikitasgrishin wrote a review Mar 2017\n",
      "50 Great experience! Excellent staff! First time in Thailand and I loved every inch of it!! My girlfriend and I spent hours online looking for somewhere to stay in Pattaya for two days. We didn't really want a busy area/hotel so this hotel was just PERFECT for us. It's a fantastic hotel in an idyllic setting with EXCELLENT STAFF, great rooms, facilities and food was AMAZING. Every member of staff went the extra mile to please their guests. We were driven around by a member of staff on our first night to find food as we arrived late at the hotel so most places were closed and then picked us up after we finished! First class service indeed! The attention to detail was just superb, from house keeping to restaurant staff services were exemplary. It's indeed a great place to relax.    Summary (pros)  1. Peaceful location  2. Very clean hotel  3. Staff and very friendly, polite and 4. EXTREMELY helpful  5. Breakfast was amazing (you order what you want from a menu and you can order as many times as you like)  6. It's about 20mins taxi ride to the south of Pattaya.  7. Mini bar in rooms are all included in the booking price I.e. Eat or drink everything in the fridge and you don't get charged extra! This does not include alcoholic drinks.

      "30 The outdoors is great for taking photos, but little else The hotel is appealing with its boutique style and architecture. The rooms are simple and modern, but with little comfort.  The breakfast is OK, but we would have appreciated some brown or cereal bread.  Outdoors is great. It is very nice with the sea, plants, trees and lawns, but with few possibilities to take a longer walk. The area is very limited and so is the swimming pool and the beach.  The sunbeds in the hotel area are few, dirty and therefore not very appealing. Around noon or so, when the sun is appearing, it is impossible to find a free sunbed or a sunbed without towels, indicating that the sunbed is occupied.  The beach is unfortunately unkempt. And there is no sunbeds at all there.  The outdoor area is a great place to take photos, but not very suitable to outdoors activities, except for a very little stroll or perhaps sunbathing if you find a free sunbed.  The staff is kind, attentive, helpful, doing their very best to please their guests.  I think the price is too high for the standard and the facilities we get in this hotel. This is obviously a four stars hotel, not five.  Look for more reviews by MulleEllum. MulleEllum wrote a review Feb 2017\n",
      "50 Paradise I like nature that's why i chose monttra. And it doesn't disappoint me at all! Starting with the welcoming drinks, friendly staffs. You already know that it can't go wrong! Even though my mom can't communicate with them because of language, she told me the staffs there are very nice! you can tell they really want to help you !  We stayed in the canopy suite. I love it so much! It is huge with big bath tub. Different from the other hotel is all the drinks and food in the fridge are free (yeah)~ although it is in nature, there is no geckos in the room at all(I'm super afraid of gecko><)  The afternoon bite and 15 massage are complimentary! Those are lovely! You can't go wrong with them !  The breakfast is amazing in the lovely and cozy restaurant! We love to having breakfast while listing to the sound of nature.  The sad thing is the weather was bad during our vacation. We had no chance to go to the swimming pool and walking around. We will come back definitely! vwvwvwvwvw wrote a review Jan 2017\n",
      "50 A jewel on the shore of pattaya Warm weather, birds singing, the waves cracking at the shore and the beautiful vegetation... nature is showing it s full potential. An atmosphere of calmness and relaxation was created by the entire Monttra team.  It s been a long time I have stayed in a hotel with such remarkable personalized service. It s the beauty of hospitality which is given 100% in this hidden oasis. The spa treatment is as well one of the best and the atmosphere in the spa bungalow is very authentic.  Little note on the side: If you book on the homepage of the hotel you get a package which includes different kind of services and many discounts on certain products and services. No OTA can compete with this offer.  I can recommend to everyone to stay in this hotel as the first choice in Pattaya. And even for holidays, it s worth to experience the untouched nature and the high quality service provided. S_Mastel wrote a review Jan 2017\n"

      "40 Beautiful Really enjoyed our stay at The Monttra. The staff was friendly and very helpful. The food was good. The view of the Gulf of Thailand was gorgeous. If we go back to Pattaya will definitely stay again. The only not so good things were the shower water temperature was hard to control. The road to the hotel is kind of barren and has mugging warning signs so I would not plan on walking to/from the hotel especially at night. Darren M wrote a review Jan 2017\n",
      "10 AVOID!! We went for dinner here with friends and experienced the worst possible service. The first items arrived over an hour after we placed our order and some of them were wrong. Things arrived randomly, but some items never arrived at all. One of my guests complained that the dish she'd been served was nothing like the description in the menu and the staff argued with her. She eventually had to call for a menu to prove her point after which they backed down - it was NOTHING like what was described on the menu. After a lot of unpleasantness we eventually decided to leave. The restaurant then tried to charge us for everything, even the things that had never arrived. This led to a long and bitter argument. Unless you're a masochist, go somewhere else. Duncan L wrote a review Jan 2017\n",
      "50 Wonderfully secluded boutique hotel, true gem I just finished my one night stay at the Monttra Pattaya as I was looking forward a secluded beach vacation after my recent business trip. The resort and staff exceeded my expectations, embodied traditional Thai decor and hospitality.    I usually prefer going to Koh Samui or the islands in the south over crazy Pattaya, however due to the constant rainfall in the south I chose to find a place closer to Bangkok. This resort only has 24 rooms so it is small and private, it has its own small swimming pool and private beach (clean, good sand, great view), and is next to the Royal Yacht club which made for a great entertainment watching the sailing on a daily basis.    I would recommend the Seabreeze room so you can get the true ocean view experience. It is very close to downtown Pattaya and I was able to take a motorcycle taxi ride for 60 baht back and forth. You can also take normal taxi, but that is not my preference.    I will definitely stay again, and my only regret is that I didn't stay longer.    Cheers, gregkmitchell wrote a review Dec 2016\n",
      "50 Lovely Rest We spent 4 days at the small boutique hotel.  We were treated like royalty.  The bedroom was clean. The bed comfortable. It was quiet and relaxing.

Excellent staff from way before we arrived until just before our departure, they gave restaurant and local recommendation before our trip, and provided us with sandwiches and water for the car ride to Bangkok after check-out. Everything in between was simply amazing and it is a real gem in Pattaya.    It is located in a quiet part of Pattaya, away from all the bars and restaurants with awesome views of the sea. It is a small resort with only 23 rooms thus don't expect huge bars, large pools and gym etc. It is one of the best place for relaxing. chung986 wrote a review Oct 2016\n",

      "50 Hidden Gem in Pattaya We stayed at The Monttra Pattaya for one night only and I can confidently say that staying only one night this was one of the poorest decision we made in month. This intimately-sized resort exudes tropical, boutique charm. The staffs are very well-trained and a real asset to the resort and although the resort is quite small service was not intrusive at all. We stayed in a sea-view room, tastefully decorated and extremely comfortable. The free minibar items are nice touches and the air-conditioning was very efficient - a bit too efficient to my liking actually. Weather was not that great so we didn't have the chance to take in the views of the sea and the small island of Koh Larn across. We had a couple of drinks and bites poolside which were great and the a la carte breakfast was pretty tasty, especially the coffee. The hotel is adjacent to the yacht club and the beach which makes for a quiet location yet a short-drive away from Phratamnak and the city. Last but not least, we booked on the hotel website and took advantage of the low season offer, including late check-out and complimentary head & shoulder massage. Julien V wrote a review Oct 2016\n",
      "50 Good Stay Great Service / Escaping from Chaos Pattaya City We were there on a weekend in October 2016 and the resort surprised us with the sanctuary for our senses.    The accommodation is not far from Pattaya city but we found serenity in tropical garden with clean beach and quite clear sea water that we long for which located close to Bangkok.    In addition, the services that staff there provided were very humble but professional.    We love the place and looking forward to be back there again.    Mek Lamcharn wrote a review Oct 2016\n",

It's a small complex secluded in a tropical garden.  The staff is helfull , professional and smiling.  Our suite (Sea Breeze) is huge , contemporary furnished, and with a great sea view .  In Infinity pool you can indulge in a relax overlooking the islands and the sea.  The thai masseurs are great, i'm dreaming an hour relax also today in Italy.  If you could look for a problem this is the breakfast, but if you made a question everyone help you to have the perfect breakfast as you desire.  Great!!! affi1975 wrote a review Aug 2016\n",

All the minibar items are free of charge. I can see some squairre on the trees. However the pool is too small to swim, the water of shower is not hot enough and the cleaningness of balcony can be better. nataliechun L wrote a review Aug 2016\n",
      "40 \"Pleasant stay\" We travelled as a family of 15 people and were pleasantly surprised by the service and natural surrounds. Although this small resort is only new, the owners were thoughtful enough to keep the trees and build around them, creating an oasis of calm and coolness,  It took a while to check-in but staff member Vicky did a great job as she was on her own and completed the lengthy process with smiles and laughs. The rooms were lovely and clean and larger than what you would normally expect in Pattaya.  We decided to stay at the resort for dinner and enjoyed a lovely meal of traditional southern style food.  The swimming pool looks directly out to the sea and is on the small side but pleasant enough for a cool down, but no laps in this pool!  Breakfast was served as a set menu with coffee or tea with toast, pastry etc and then you could choose a full cooked breakfast as well. Plenty of variety for all tastes.  Overall an enjoyable stay made better by pleasant and friendly staff. Good value as the resort is new and clean and well managed. guig wrote a review Jul 2016\n"

      "50 Little Oasis In A Hectic Town Pro - Where do I start....  Its a beautiful, private, quiet and serene place tucked away in the hustle and bustle of Pattaya (a 25 room boutique hotel). Has a short stretch of private beach and the view is priceless.....  We booked the limo service from the hotel and was pleased with the price and comfort provided.  Checking in was brief and very personal (loved the fact that they addressed by our name correctly, right the moment we stepped out of the limo - you don't get that now even from a 5star hotel).  Rooms were creative, minimal design and the view was great (regrated not booking the sea view rooms).  The pool of course wasn't big but it served it purpose for relaxing.  The food was great and their refreshing juices are delicious. Loved the idea that the breakfast was not buffet spread but was customized 10 set menu where you are open to choose as many sets as you wish. Free flow of fresh fruit juices was an additional oomph. also appreciate the the mini bar was free and was filled everyday for us to enjoy.  The staffs were helpful, beautiful and greeted you whenever you bumped into one.  Loved the thai oil massage too....    And the list can go on and on....    Con - Nothing (suprising for me as I am a very picky traveler especially when it comes to hotels).    Appreciate Victoria and Pooh who was tirelessly making sure we were comfortable throughout our stay.    Will be back soon......for sure...

      "30 DISAPPOINTED! We stayed at this hotel for 12 nights in a Canopy Suite.    First of all the good points:    Very peaceful surroundings. Really friendly staff. Rooms nice but not without issues (see negative points)! Bed really comfortable. Good shower. Good air conditioning.    Now the negative points:    Breakfast was a fiasco. Over 12 nights we had exactly what we ordered on only 2 occasions. We used to joke about it on our way to breakfast “I wonder what we’ll have for breakfast today” and “Let’s order what we don’t want in the hope of getting what we do want”!! One morning I ordered scrambled egg, and eventually was delivered an overcooked omelette. I sent it back only to have it delivered to me again 2 minutes later with the omelette chopped up in an attempt to make it look like scrambled. I feel sorry for the young people serving as they don’t have a great grasp of the English language and have basically been dropped in at the deep end.    The room. Generally nice, but not as clean as you would expect. There was a urine stain on the toilet when we checked in. The bath needed a good clean inside and out. Mildew in the shower. All the internal glass in the room was smeared and dirty. The design of the curtain rails mean that it is impossible to shut out all the light, so be prepared for an early morning wake up! Although the photographs you see on the Monttra website make it appear the Canopy suites are individual bungalows, they are in fact semi-detached and you can actually feel the people next door walking around. There is no wardrobe, just a hanging rail. This I can live with, but there was NO drawer space whatsoever which is fine for people only staying 2 nights, but living out of a suitcase for 12 nights is a bit much.    The cushions/padding on the sun beds on the balcony are left exposed all the time. If we had not put them under the overhang of the roof at night they would have been soaking wet the next day (it rained most nights). Maybe it is something the turn-down team should do in the evening. Stained beach towels.    Apparently there is a soap concierge (never saw him/her) thankfully. In fact the tiny bar of soap in the room was not replaced until the last day.    The beach is accessible by dodgy steps. Be careful. Once you get there you will find it’s not really worth the effort. Although the water is lovely and warm, judging by all the rubbish on the beach you should be very careful of going in the water without footwear. The next cove round to the left has a far nicer beach.    The mosquitos and flies are a real problem. They would turn the fan on at breakfast in an attempt to keep the flies at bay, but it didn’t work. We have never had so many mosquito bites in 20 years of travelling to Thailand, often staying in comparable garden type properties. Buy some mosquito spray from the local 7/11. Check the mosquito vaporiser in the room – as ours was empty.    The manager was conspicuous by his absence. The only time we saw him was when our taxi arrived to take us to Bangkok on our final day. We were just about to get into the taxi when the young lady at reception asked us to please wait as the manager wanted to talk to us. We assumed he wanted to address the many issues we had encountered (some we have not mentioned here). He offered a half hearted apology, but he could have done this before the taxi arrived or even the day before.    TO SUMMARISE: In our opinion the food and service are definitely not 5*. The hotel could be wonderful but seems to lack direction and attention to detail. It talks the talk but doesn’t walk the walk. We note that Viktoria responds to all the good reviews on Trip Adviser, but not the negative ones. Maybe the negative ones are those that she needs to concentrate on?

      "50 Just amazing What a petty I have not found this place earlier - what a hidden gem. It was my first time in Thailand and due to a short trip (9 days) I choose Pattaya for my and my friends destination to be (only 2 hrs from Bangkok with the car).    I found The Monttra due to recommendation and the pictures as well reputation online letting me falling in love before I have even arrive there. The real one is even more stunning. What makes this place really magical is the staff. I heard that Thailand is the country of the 'smile' and their team has brought it to the fullest of warm, helpful and also professional service. Thanks for giving me a memorable stay and I promise I will be back to see you all again!!    Vicky and her team did an amazing job, thanks for that again:-) Jill S wrote a review Jun 2016\n",

It is so quiet and relaxing in the gardens with the private beach and the (little bit smaller but great) pool. Special thanks to Kok and Bouw in the restaurant as their helpful and smiling being has been the right start into my day at breakfast. The breakfast concept by the way is great as you do not have to do anything else than order what you want and everything will be served for your convenience - hell yeah!!  The soaps they have are all organic, the pool water is with salt and no chlorine, the have sunscreen for use if you forgot yours, free fruit drink in the afternoon, FREE MASSAGE!!

Had the seaview room with the lil pool and it's really lovely.Nice quiet place to sit outside and watch the sun go down.

This property shares a piece of land with Varuna Yacht Club located in such a beautiful part of Phatumnak Hill with its own private beach. This is an ultimate getaway for people who doesn't want to go away too far and still enjoy a little bit of civilization. Food is amazing in both taste and quality. Staff is super friendly and well-trained in service. Rooms are spacious. My first trip we got a regular room type with garden view which is still pretty good. The2nd time we get a bigger room with an ocean view which is better. Because this is not a big resort you feel like you know everyone and they are your family and friends and thats what I love most about this place. Highly recommend this to everyone. It's something that you have to try and I ensure you that you will be back! WIMINTRA wrote a review May 2016\n",
      "50 OH YES!!! In a way, I have to say thank you to our usual resort. Thank you for being fully book, otherwise I wouldn't have come across this stunning oasis. If you are looking for a peaceful, relaxing spot to unwind then this is the place to be.  The resort is set out in a wonderful green garden right on the ocean with the accomodations nicely blended into the garden. When you enter the premise you will already notice one of the highlights of the hotel, the staff. They are absolutely wonderful in any aspect and make your stay a bliss.  We had booked one of the canopy suits, which was very spacious and beautifully equipped and comes with its own private terrace overlooking the ocean.  The restaurant serves delicious meals and the breakfasts are worth waking up for. If you look for your typical hotel buffet breakfast then this is not the place for you. The breakfast was cooked to order with a choice of delicious meals and the staff taking care that no wish was unfulfilled.  Overall one of the most relaxing holidays we had in a long time.  A special thanks to the staff of the monttra! SayaNG26 wrote a review May 2016\n",
      "50 Pattaya Hide Away The most beautiful view in Pattaya. I love the hotel, staff are very friendly & Thai food here is really good. I highly recommend for couples or family get away. It felt like I was in a boutique hotel in Phuket or Samui, not in Pattaya. MrsSchwyn wrote a review Apr 2016\n",
      "50 An absolute GEM in what is a dirty, tourist ridden city! So much good to say about this place, private beach, amazing gardens, lighting at night superb, staff friendly . . just a lovely trip on my part! Sunsets over the sea!    I suppose the sailing club and screaming kids, whistles from teachers are the ONLY thing that disturbed my stay . . :( Jon K wrote a review Apr 2016\n",
      "50 Spa Review: Massage I didn't stay at The Monttra in Pattaya but in a spot nearby. I did, however, take the opportunity to pop into the new spot and check out the style and ambiance of the hotel (very nice) and also tried out the spa. The spa has outside tables for massage. It was lovely + perfect for Thailand. The masseur was well trained and did wonders for my sore shoulder. I am looking forward to another visit. johanna102 wrote a review Apr 2016\n",

      "50 All in all: WE LOVED IT I've stayed at The Monttra for a couple of days with my friend and we enjoyed it to the fullest. The atmosphere with its trees, the infinity pool and the private beach is perfect for relaxing and just taking time for yourself. The food is OK but still needs some improvement. Even though it wasn't a big deal for us because the waitress has perfectly managed the situation.  I've been to Thailand many times now and I've traveled lot of different places in the country. Of course I have experienced lots of different kindesses and smiling faces of pleople - it, most of the time, is unreal and not honest. But at The Monttra they welcome you kindly, provide full and outstanding service from the buttom of their hearts. Especially Victoria, we will keep her in mind with her ability of serving us the best of the best with her team during our stay. Thank you very much for everything! We will defenitely come back as soon as possible. MaxwellArt wrote a review Apr 2016\n",
      "50 Awesome getaway - blissful side of pattaya We visited in April 1 2016..I must say that the property presents the heavenly sight of pattaya...with direct sea breeze rooms.    The ambience is fantastic, with sounds of waves and birds chirping.    The rooms are magnificently designed.    The best part is the staff, who make you feel like Kings and queens, with their love affection, and with so much love you feel in bliss.    I must congratulate Victoria for managing this property with so much professionalism and going all the way out to help out guests..I think that's she is one more reason to visit given the caring and love she showers on her guests.    Keep up the good work and this is definitely a place to be at.    Room 203 (April 1 to april2)  Cool love Cool777love wrote a review Apr 2016\n",
      "50 A very romantic hotel experience For those want tranquility in Pattaya, this new boutique hotel is the answer. Located at the seaside with a small beach shared with the marina club next door, it offers very nice rooms with detailed decoration that blend well with the environment. I particularly compliment the staff for their attentive service and eagerness to give the customers a very pleasant experience. All in all, an excellent choice of resort in Pattaya away from the crowds. Selina L wrote a review Mar 2016\n",

I went out twice to center festival at pattya beach, it s not easy to come back by taxi. Most of taxi driver doesn t know the location, i tried 10 times of taxi in 2 night. probably, it s still new hotel. When i show them the hotel business card n map provide fr hotel, they still confused. I suggest to get a esay map show up on the hotel business card. Good lucky get bk tonite.

      "50 Beautiful setting and friendly staff Gorgeous hotel located on the outskirts of Pattaya. A perfect oasis away from the busy nightlift and beach front with amazing, spotless air conditioned rooms and scenic views. The bed is one of the most comfotable I have ever slept on!!  The staff are very attentive and go out of their way to ensure you have a pleasant stay. The service was a little slow at times considering the cost of the hotel, but this did not affect our stay too much. Taxis to the main beach front area can be arranged by the hotel and are reasonably priced although they do charge a higher price (300 baht as opposed to the 100 baht we managed to get a tuk tuk for)  All in all this is a beautiful hotel and a perfect location to enjoy and explore Pattaya. We would highly recommend and will hopefully be back soon! Lynnybmx wrote a review Mar 2016\n",
      "50 Beautiful property with private beach and stunning service Stayed here with my wife for 3 days in February. Absolutely loved the property and it has the potential to become one of Pattaya's best. The property itself is tucked away from the general hustle and bustle with a private beach shared only with the Royal Varuna Yacht club. A few clubs and restaurants are within walking distance although we rented a bike.  We preferred that this was a small property with only about 25 rooms which made it very quaint and less crowded. Our room (sea breeze suite) was spacious and had a fabulous view especially during the sunset. The infinity pool was great and was never crowded when we were there. The staff were exceptional (Pooh, Cha, Aom and others), always looking to help and giving us advise about the resort and the area.  Another thing we loved was the \"All day\" breakfast which gave us the freedom to wake up whenever we wanted and have breakfast instead of getting up with an alarm and rushing to the restaurant before service ends. They also served the breakfast in our room (out on the porch) when we requested.  The only complaint was that the breakfast was inconsistent in presentation and taste. The restaurant menu is also very limited. But we can put it down to being a new property (opened only 3 months back) and they have assured me that work is already in progress to improve the quality of food.  Overall, an awesome stay with impeccable service. Will definitely stay here if I visit Pattaya again!! Sudharshan R wrote a review Mar 2016\n"

      "50 Stunning service This is undoubtably one of the best small boutique hotels I have stayed in. The room was spacious and well designed, with lots of space and a great balcony. What makes this hotel really stand out is the amazing staff, their attention to detail is truly excellent. One morning I was having breakfast and got bitten by a mosquito on my foot, literally 20 seconds later one of the staff ran up with spray, I hadn't asked she just saw me scratching, that is true service and attention.

      "50 Great for perfect holiday Perfect location for relax, it's peaceful. Room and place is new and clean. It has all amenities that you need in your rooms. All mini bar are free. Also 15 minute/guest massage is free (Don't sure this for every room type or not). Staffs are friendly and have service mind. Anyway I think main pool is too small. But it's not matter, because you can walk down to beach just few steps. The restaurant is pretty, you can have dinner with sunset view. The menu 's not varied, but it's good taste. Made to order breakfast is very good. Hemmawan wrote a review Feb 2016\n",
      "50 Quiet hideaway New small resort. Very nice location right on a private beach. Houses are nestled among old trees. Staff very friendly and helpful. Breakfast very rich and good variety. Food in general very good with nice little details.  It is slightly outside with not much around. But perfect if you look for a quiet break away from the hustle and noise. We will be back.

      "50 Perfect few days by the beach Thank you to all the staff at The Monttra for an idyllic end to our holiday. We had four lovely nights at this new hotel and can thoroughly recommend it. It is an intimate boutique hotel with only a few rooms, a gorgeous infinity pool and private beach shared with the yacht club down a few steps. It faces west, so every evening you are treated to a beautiful sunset. The staff are very friendly and do everything they can to make the stay enjoyable.    The included daily a la carte breakfast is fantastic - with lots of unique combinations, great coffee and freshly squeezed juice. We particularly liked the savoury crepe. It is also very fast service - unlike the suggestions of previous reviews.    In addition there is a free mini bar (with soft drinks, water and snacks) refilled every day and complimentary 20 minute back and shoulder massage which is very relaxing - and we had ours by the pool. Some of other reviews suggest there are not enough sun loungers - but given the hotel is so small this was not a problem for us as there were always beds available. There is plenty of space in the garden for the hotel to add more if they need in the future. You can collect mats and towels for the beach from the reception area.    Dinner at the restaurant is delightful - excellent and creative cooking. The cocktails and smoothies are a particular highlight and we drank our way through the menu. The Lychee Tini was a favourite. We also walked to two other local restaurants. The Cliff Club is about 5 mins walk away - it has a different vibe to the hotel, more flashy but has great service and Thai food, especially the sea bass with curry sauce. The Cabbages and Condoms (yes - weird name, but it supports an HIV charity) is about 20 mins walk or 200BHT local taxi and set on terraces right above the sea. There is not much else close to the hotel but this was perfect for us as we wanted a quiet and peaceful retreat and wanted to avoid central Pattaya. There is a 7-11 supermarket five minutes up the hill if needed.    The rooms are large and well decorated. The only improvement needed is some drawers for clothes storage, as well as the hanging space.    The hotel has only been open a few months so we had a discount which made the trip great value: check the website directly to see if there are any currently available. I'm sure the hotel will only go from strength to strength with such a fantastic team of staff and gorgeous location. Anna598 wrote a review Feb 2016\n",
      "50 Perfect Good location. Great way to relax away from the crowded Pattaya. Excellent staff, they will take care of all of your needs. Not so many choices for breakfast but all of them are good. I stayed here for 7 days and I don't have anything to complain about it. The only thing that is strange is that there are only 6 longchairs but I totally get it because they want to maintaim the chicness of the place. When i will come back in this part of the world I will definetly stay here. Marco P wrote a review Feb 2016\n",
      "50 Excellent service , peaceful stay We really enjoyed our stay here. The service was fantastic , the staff was extremely courteous.

Perfect for a weekend escape when you just need to get away :) Kaushikpr wrote a review Feb 2016\n",
      "30 Not living up to its potential... Beautiful little oasis set overlooking a small secluded beach next to the Yacht club in Pattaya. A very friendly welcome by the ever smiling guest relations girl who is keeping this hotel afloat at present by attending to the many issues that desperately need ironed out at this newly opened boutique hotel in its infancy. Number one issue was the fiddly padlocks on the doors-extremely frustrating to navigate; reminiscent of a cheap beach side room from my back packing days and did not feel safe. Food: Staff are completely overwhelmed by the fiddly nature of the breakfast service-orange juice in test tubes, fiddly spoon plates of jam and condiments. Internet service was intermittent to non existent. The room had a large balcony which had one sad lonely sun bed-no patio chairs or pleasing decorative features such as plants and was therefore unattractive and un-usable. The room was modern and nicely decorated but again lacked useable comfortable furniture. The spa for massages turned out to be a hut and did not deliver the ambiance that one would expect from this calibre of hotel. There were other issues experienced with food/drinks service and with our room but to be fair the staff are working hard to solve these teething problems and one gets the impression of a hotel that is simply not quite ready yet...which is a shame as it could be a real gem.

      "40 So much potential, will be THE BEST! This hotel was a five day last minute break for my fiancé and I. We wanted sun, sea, sand and comfort. We got all of these things.    Staff-especially Viktoria and Pooh-are fantastic and cannot do enough to help you. We had to call the doctor for my fiancé's food poisoning and they looked after else so well-nothing was too much bother.    The setting is beautiful-far away from God-awful Pattaya but close enough to access all the restaurants and other amenities the city offers.    Food is freshly cooked and delicious but slightly over-priced. Cocktails too are delicious with great variety: they're mixed as well as a 5* London bar.    Rooms are clean and so comfortable-the beds are like marshmallows!    However, there needs to be some changes going forward:    Service at breakfast is so slow and this is because it is over-complicated. As well as your plate, there are tens of pots of preserves, dressings, fruit, salad etc.    Sun beds-there are none on the beach and only 6 around the pool. This needs to be changed as sun worshippers miss out.    As the main area is like a canopy of beautiful tall trees the pool is FREEZING. It needs to be heated. The canopy also means that only two beds get sun but only after 12.30. The beach gets sun post 10.30.    Beach- all the rubbish from Pattaya comes floating in and it would be nice if the staff cleaned this up. Some unsanitary/dangerous items such as broken glass wash up so could be an issue for children playing down there.    Menu-same for dinner as lunch therefore a bit repetitive although the kitchen do cater for specific desires/tweaks to what is on there.    When the above are addressed this will be without doubt the BEST HOTEL IN PATTAYA (and sadly the prices will probably sky-rocket making it too expensive for us!!).    Thank you team for a fabulous holiday! sunworshipersunited wrote a review Feb 2016\n"

      "50 Amazing stay at the Monttra I have had the great pleasure to stay at the Monttra in January 2016 and I just felt overwhelmed.  When I first stepped into the room, I was impressed about the spacious size and the selected colors which makes it even more stunning. Beautifully located in Pattaya, a place I am usually not too keen of, we were able to enjoy the sunsets in the evening from the infity pool. What else can you ask for?  The hotel opened its doors just recently, but nevertheless the staff knew exactly what to do and how to make me feel like at home. The check in from Miss Aom has been very welcome and gracious and Miss Pooh has helped and assist us during our stay in every matter. Special appreciation goes to the young and dynamic Ms Viktoria as she has taken care of us throughout the whole stay. How she threats the guests, if in the morning at breakfast or the evening for dinner, is phenomenal. Thank you and your team for such a great stay - the Monttra is definitely different than other Hotel in Pattaya and not only for its location. BoomBapTraveller wrote a review Feb 2016\n",
      "50 Wonderful time at The Monttra This newly opened boutique resort is a jewel in an otherwise bleak Pattaya. Its location on Pratumnak Hill is sensational and the architects have done great and highly creative work with the land at hand. Of course, being creative and different in such radical ways also bears potential of things go slightly wrong. But come time these minor deficiencies will be eliminated, I am sure. The Monttra is the kind of place you would not want to leave for 24 hours - because being there is simply a marvellous experience: Be it on a lounger and just looking out at the sea (with spectacular sundowns), be it in the lovely infinity pool with its superb water quality, be it in the generous and perfectly equipped rooms and suites (exception: missing shelves), be it sitting in the probably most nicely set restaurant in all of Pattaya. My wife and I spent 5 wonderful days and nights at The Monttra and we will certainly be coming back should we pass nearby again in one of our regular Thailand trips.

      "30 Forget the gimmicks and deliver comfort and efficiency My wife booked this hotel at the last moment for us as an alternative to our planned weekend away from Bangkok at the old Six Senses property in Hua Hin.Although this hotel had only been open 6 weeks it had a couple of gushing reviews on tripadvisor.It was priced the same as  our other options, the five star Evason in Hua Hin,and the five star Royal Cliff nearby to this.    Key issues:  1.The \"suite\" comprises one armchair and one armless desk chair.The seat base slides off the chair and is thus useable only in a rigid upright position.The patio has a flat bench with pad with no back or arms.It is therefore impossible for two people to relax inside or outside of the \"suite\".Upon unpacking we realized there was no shelving at all for our clothes.The \"suite\" is of course a room but as with much on the company's website,embellishments seem the norm.This is a resort with likely two occupants in a room,not a downtown business hotel single user who is out most of the day.The room door is accessed by an ornate padlock and flimsy treasure chest key,time consuming and fiddly to open.Just be normal and use a door lock and key or an electronic keycard.    2.The Internet was intermittent at best.The signal to the rooms is weak and comes and goes probably usable about 50% of the time.It seemed a problem for many guests.    3.Breakfast took over an hour on three of four mornings with inadequately trained staff.It is overcomplicated and gimmicky,leading to constant service delivery issues.The menu for lunch and dinner consists entirely of Thai options in entrees so rather than stay in the hotel throughout,which was our preference,we left to mostly eat elsewhere to gain more variety.  The food we did have was sadly the poorest of our trip and this is a country where food options and quality are wonderful from the smallest roadside vendor to the best luxury hotels.    4.There are only six sun loungers for twenty three rooms by the pool and grounds and no umbrellas.However,more worryingly I was struck by the falling bough of a tree when on a lounger.Fortunately it hit me flat rather than vertically which would have resulted in serious injury rather than just alarm.Until this is resolved,the grounds are inherently dangerous as the resort is contained almost totally under a canopy of trees.It needs to be addressed urgently.    4.The hotel trumpets its difference giving a \"soap concierge\" and \"skin concierge\" neither of whom made an appearance(thankfully!).Skip the gimmicks and deliver the product first.    Strengths  It could be the best hotel in the area.Its a good location nicely secluded away from the dreadful city of Pattaya and overlooks the sea with a very nice private beach shared with the adjacent Yacht Club.The small staff were old fashioned caring Thai supervised by the highly professional and long suffering Swiss Guest Services Manager Victoria.The General Manger was nowhere to be seen during our five day stay.The management company Miners were also absent from their first new hotel six weeks into opening leaving the Guest Services Manager to deal with all issues.This was inexcusable given the not unexpected challenges that occur immediately post opening.    It could be very good if comfort and safety are prioritized before design and gimmicks and the managers actually attend on site.The small staff deserve better from them, David P wrote a review Feb 2016\n",
      "50 Another World to Pattaya I've stayed there with my wife at a Garden Suite a few days after the opening. Surely we realized they had just opened but I must say we were absolutely amazed. We certainly didn't expect this kind of property in Pattaya and they linked it with some amazing services like a Soap Concierge. Very cool angle. We also got 20min free massage which was fantastic. The guy was from Indonesia so I chose to add another 1h to it.    The breakfast was great. I love the choice. I really hate those boring breakfast buffets but they have come up with a cool concept.    All in all it is highly recommended. They put a different angle to everything about Hospitality and we travel a lot. We know when something is different to the general hotellerie. Mendes Osiris C wrote a review Jan 2016\n",
      "50 Hidden Gem in Pattaya I have lived in Thailand 10 years and this is by far one of the best hotels I have ever had the pleasure of staying.    Monttra is a stunning boutique resort that feels like you are in a \"magic\" land. The gardens are beautiful and surround an infinity pool that over looks your own private beach. The rooms are designed with the greatest attention to detail and are really spectacular. We stayed in ALL the room types and they are all equally amazing. The villas overlook the ocean.    The staff is superb, the room service is great, and the restaurant offers good food with a beautiful view. The breakfast is huge and really nicely displayed.    Massages are wonderful and you can order to your room or even have them poolside. I suggest Khun Nok, she is great!    The location is very private, but you can walk to 7-11 and several restaurants in 5 minutes time. californiaduckie wrote a review Jan 2016\n",

Private beach yes. Great service team also yes.    They have a jug of welcome drink in the suite as well as the lobby - with lime, and cucumber - refreshing. Olive oil soap. Rain shower.    Excited to be here on their opening day. Am sure to return for more. Love the sound of the waves during a late night check-in.    Very well appointed suites. Fast internet too and really great bed.

      "10 Never actually got to stay. I booked this place online through booking.com well in advance of my arrival in September. I booked two large rooms for myself and a friend I was traveling with. A few days before my departure I received an email to inform me they where expecting my arrival, so all seemed OK.  We arrived in Pattaya and found the guesthouse, it was all closed up and nobody was around. We spoke to a lady over the road and and she phoned the owner of the guesthouse for us. About 10 minutes later she arrived and told us there had been a mistake with the booking and only one room was available.  I went through the booking with her and even showed her the email she had sent me. She just apologised and said she had made a mistake.  We checked into a guesthouse directly opposite. In the few days we stayed in this guesthouse I saw no signs of life at Mai Lu Si. The bar opened up at night but the guesthouse seemed to be closed and unoccupied.  The sign outside indicated that the place was for sale. andyhindle wrote a review Sep 2016\n",
      "40 I Was Pleasantly Surprised I recently spent a few days in Bangkok visiting my son and decided to head down to Pattaya for a couple of days before going home to Phuket. Each time I had visited Pattaya in the past I had always stayed near the beach so I opted to stay away from that expensive area and opted for the area around Soi Buakhow this time.    I had never stayed in this area but had heard that it was where the Ex-Pats frequented because of the inexpensive bars and restaurants.    While traveling my mini-bus from Bangkok to Pattaya I booked my first night at a place called Valentine's Guest House. What a mistake. I wouldn't let my dog stay there. I decided to stay one more day so the following morning I booked a room at the \"It's Me\" guest house with an arrival time of 11:00 am. I arrived at the given time only to find the place locked up with a teen age Thai boy sleeping on the floor inside. I woke him up and he asked me to wait outside for a moment.    Thirty minutes later I walked away, canceling the booking and making a new booking for Mai Lu Si Guest House about 500 meters away.    I found the guest house on a small side street across from the Pattaya City Hospital. The street was lined with brand new guest houses all with staff outside trying to lure me in. The guest house appeared new as well housing a bar on the first floor.    The staff here had to be awakened as well but took care of my check in right away. While I was walking to my room on the second floor I noticed large speakers in the bar and was concerned about the noise at night.    The room was large with a balcony overlooking the street. The furnishings, while being cheaply made, were brand new. The air conditioning was new and worked well. The mattress was firm and comfortable. There were two large, overstuffed chairs facing the flat screen television. The bathroom was clean and the shower came with a hot water heater. An electronic lock box was mounted to the wall.    Even with the large speakers in the bar and the balcony overlooking the street the room was very quiet at night.    There were no bars of soap in the bathroom so if you book this guest house you may want to consider bringing your own.    For only 600 Baht a night this room was well worth it.

Room size small but ok. old furniture including a broken table and the shower tap was coming off the wall. The room was not clean a mass of foreign hair in the room and bathroom.  I always leave a tip for the cleaner when I go to a hotel or guesthouse. unfortunately this was the first place I decided not to. Shame    Much better places to stay in the location Jimmross wrote a review Nov 2019\n",

      "40 Very good and cheap place Typical professionally run hotel with the bar and restaurant downstairs open 24h. Clean spacious rooms with the modern bathroom, tv with english channels, ac, fridge and really comfortable large bed. Property is located in the middle of everything, plenty of bars with music open late night, many restaurants and grocery shops around. Easy walking distance to the the beach and Walking Streat (around 10min) Just a bit noisy during the night becouse of the music from surrounding bars, but nothing tragic.

      "40 Good place Right on soi Diana, good rooms and a nice sports bar which is open 24/7 and shows Swedish sports.  It is great that the owner answers questions very fast and for those who need it they have elevator to the rooms. Tegian wrote a review Apr 2019\n",
      "40 Friendly bar and restaurant. Room on upper floor was very generous size. Queen bed and clean linens. Adequate bathroom and toilet. We had a balcony room which overlooked Soi Diana, but no noise entered our room. Airconditioing was very good. Breakfast was simple but good enough for the price. An elevator was a great for us of advancing years....very well received, and fast. Would definitely recommend.This hotel is right in the middle of all the action. Better than walking street.

      "40 Very nice friendly bar My friend and I visited this bar on a daily basis whilst in Pattaya and found the staff very attentative and friendly at all times.    The prices are extremely good and the food is excellent I would certainly recommend a visit to this bar if you are a in the area as I am sure you will not be disappointed.    Well done for to all staff. Mark K wrote a review Aug 2018\n",
      "50 Harry's, a laid back establishment, great location and top quality Scandinavian food! I can't express how happy I am to have found Harry's!  Last week I was invited to the Zip Lounge (Soi Diana) for a charity event regarding cleaning up the beaches and rubbish in Pattaya. Lovely event, and a noble cause, with great entertainment. But the highlight was the food they served. I was very impressed with the steak medalians in Tarragon suace and the Chicken in pepper sauce. It was real 5 star quality which surprised me! I asked the host who was the chef and I was introduced to 2 Swedish chefs who work across the street at an establishment called \"Harry's\"!  I inquired about the sauces and the chefs explained to me the long and detailed process of making both the pepper sauce and the taragon sauce. The pepper sauce uses 3 kinds of pepper and takes 3 days to prepare! The taragon sauce requires special mixture of boiling and preperation as well, however the recipies I'm not allowed to reveal on pain of death!  Already impressed with the taste, quality and presentation of the food, but then the chefs told me I should try the lunch specials at Harry's for only 99 Baht!  My first reaction was disbelief, how can you survive selling quality food for 99 BahtI The answer was simple, they don't make money on the food, they make it on the drinks! Fair enough, and all the better for the punter!  So yesterday I went to try the lunch special. I arrived at an open air, double shophouse size establishment, with a big bar, but plenty of tables and a great view of Soi Diana!  I noticed there were many Swedes and a couple tables of Thais enjoying lunch and chatting. I sat down and checked out the menu, it all looked good,and the prices were very reasonable. But I came for the Lunch Special and was handed the special lunch menu, looked good, so I chose the Cheese burger with fries (99 Baht) and thought, lets see. To my surprise it was a great burger and it had some of that lovely pepper sauce! So Delicious!  Feeling ecstatic from the burger I decided to indulge myself further and ordered desert, an Apple Cake with hot Vanilla sauce. It cost more than the lunch (145 Baht) but wow, it was huge, and absolutley scrumptious!  I have found my new favourite restaurant in the heart of pattaya right on Soi Diana just off of Soi Bukaow. (Next door to the Metropole Hotel)  I will go back again and try everything else on the menu, one visit at a time!  Best Swedish food I've had in Pattaya and the best prices! I hope they do well, it's good to have a place where one can eat well, enjoy a drink or two, and watch the silly traffic on Soi Diana! Doc P wrote a review Jul 2018\n",
      "50 Always good at Harry’s Always a pleasure to stop in at Harry’s  If only for a cold one or something to eat  Always good service and smiling faces there  If you like to just chill out and do some people watching then this is the place to sit always something interesting happening on the street outside  Or if you are up for a chat not to hard to drum up a Conversation with people sitting there  In regards to nightlife at Harry’s I don’t know but if it’s anything like the daytime atmosphere I would say it would be very busy 255100Scotty68 wrote a review Jun 2018\n",
      "30 10 nights in harrys stayed 10 nights here £8-50 a night room without balcony or window with a towel for a curtain shower fine tv fine bed large and comfortable room cleaned every day fresh linen and towels. reception is fine easy check in safety deposit box 1000 baht deposit the food in the bar restaurant is very nice the thai dishes in particular and inexpensive what lets the place down is the staff the most sullen bad tempered thais i have ever met with a couple of exceptions you were left in no doubt they did not want to serve you often ignoring you or greeting you with a \"what do you want\" in fact one night i was told to\"sit sit\" like i was her dog .there is a 24hr bar but nothing is done to encourage custom usually thru the night the lights are off and so is tv and music so quite why it remains open is a mystery think the staff believe they are paid to be on their phones play pool or chat amongst themselves when you ask to be served is usually with bad grace so sorry harry your hotel could be so much better if your staff would maybe smile once in a while just for that wont be back Richard B wrote a review May 2018\n",
      "40 Messed up booking, but sorted very well, Thank you. Have stayed there before, hence why we all rebooked; this is an updated review:  So a group of us booked in advance; something went wrong but Harrys resolved very well, and booked us into their sister hotel 'Zip' opposite which is of a higher standard (see separate review):  They honored the rate (as Zip Hotel should have been more expensive) for the days we originally booked, and gave us all a complimentary meal.  You cant say fairer than that. WorldTravellingDiver wrote a review May 2018\n",
      "50 Awesome stay Hi, i stayed in this hotel from 05-04-2018 to 09-04-2018. I was their for the first time but the friendly environment and service by Team Harrys was awesome for me to stay.

      "50 Great location, Friendly staff. Good basic but spacious and clean rooms. Great location and Friendly staff. (the owner introduced himself to us all most evenings, and even performs music there, so is visible).  Good basic but spacious and clean rooms.  Two types of rooms: with or without (very cheap!) windows.  All basic, but perfectly functional and CLEAN, along with Air con, Television, Fridge, Free Water, Towels and Free Wifi, nice bathrooms HOT shower!  Friendly staff, and a lively happy bar below (also does food) should you not wish to venture out.  TIP: booking via an online company bizarrely seemed to get a better rate and include breakfast.  The bar has screens of sport (set at nice 'background' sound levels!! so you can still all talk, and there is music most nights). They also do food and non expensive drinks, and free pool table too).

      "30 False Advertising and not the cheapest I visited this restaurant whilst on holiday in Pattaya and was attracted in by the cheap beer they were offering. 49 Baht for a beer however when I got the bill the beer was actually 60 Baht. I know it was not a massive price increase but still felt I was falsely led in. The food was very tasty and I had the rack of ribs however was near enough UK Prices! £8.50 for a Rack of Ribs, They were tasty but you can get the same quality of not slightly better if you eat elsewhere. The wifi was free and fast and they had Sky Sports news which was an added bonus. I doubt I will be back to this restaurant however I imagine it will have some great atmosphere in the evenings.

      "50 Coffee at Harry's I stayed at the Areca because I wanted a pool and a gym, but I did have coffee at Harry's on several days and I can rate the staff.    In my opinion, Harry's staff were really lovely, very friendly with the old guys and very helpful. i enjoyed listening to their banter and their laughter and I enjoyed my time there.    Unfortunately, I have to work on this holiday so spent hours each day editing my book. The staff were attentive to me, but also left me alone. There was a really nice balance With good service that was not always in your face.    The coffee was the best in Pattaya and at 30 baht a real bargain.    I liked my time at Harry's. chrissalisbury2017 wrote a review Aug 2017\n",
      "30 You get what you pay for Called in to sample the advertised Sunday roast and boy was I disappointed. On offer was extremely fatty lamb, tasteless pork slices, what seemed like boiled chicken thighs with a selection of soft stodgy veg including powdered mashed potatoes with vile gravy.    Sure, it's a decent place and in a good location but if anywhere is going to advertise a 'roast' then this is what it ought to be; not stewed over cooked stuff kept fermenting in a Bain Marie that is simply completely unsuitable for the task.    Yes, you get what you pay for and at only 195b you certainly get what you pay for - oh how I wish I'd gone to the street food vendor opposite serving spaghetti.    Come on Harry - you can so much better than this. Increase your prices if needs must but hopefully there will be a corresponding increase in the quality.    PS:- please stop all those annoying street sellers coming into the bar every few minutes - they are nothing other than a complete nuisance. Jim H wrote a review Aug 2017\n",
      "10 Disappointing Harry's is a bar with accomodation on Soi Diana and from the outside is probably one of the best looking on the street. Based on what I had seen I booked a room but disappointed from the word go.  The room was fairly cheap as it was low season but in this case I only got what I paid for...it's one of those places that would benefit from a good resident DIY man to keep the rooms maintained. In my room the vanity table drawer collapsed on the floor whenever I touched it, the shower tap regularly came off in my hand, the balcony door would not close and lock unless some force was applied, the door to the room would not lock until many attempts had been made (mentioned it to the owner, nothing done about it).  As for the room itself, it was ok decor wise and benefited from good air-con but there was no extractor in the backroom so that became like a sauna at times. Worst of all there was no in-room safe. The website didn't mention this and so I was forced to pay 1,000baht (for the key which was returned when I finished with it) to use a safety deposit box. These were very small and were useless to protect electronics and so my expensive headphones and small bridge camera were left in the room because I couldn't get them in the box. The room key security was a joke - these weren't behind a large counter but were hanging on the wall at the entrance and you simply hung up your key or picked it up as you came and went. I could have taken any key on display at any time. Considering I had valuables in my room I couldn't store in the security box, it was disgraceful.  The staff could be troublesome as on my first day there I returned to my room at lunchtime, discovered it hadn't been cleaned, put the \"clean my room\" sign on my door and popped out. I returned an hour later only to be stopped in the middle of the bar by an irate member of staff waving her arms about and shouting at me that the rooms had to be cleaned before mid-day. I calmly pointed out that it was my first day there, that there were no signs stating this was the practice and the in-room folder had no mention of it. She continued to lose her temper and so I asked her to show me where the in-room folder mentioned it, she couldn't, I told her that's why I didn't know but promised it wouldn't happen again and walked off before I was embarrassed further. That lady frowned at me every time I saw her for the next week and a half...hardly the Land Of Smiles!  The food available was quite good but a little expensive and the menu was very limited. 10 yards down the road is Robin's Nest which has good food, a larger menu and better prices (it's also has air-con eating area which means you can eat in comfort). I ate there far more than I did at Harry's and I suggest you at least try the same should you stay at Harry's.  So, overall Harry's looks great from the outside but poor room maintenance, lousy staff and nonexistent security drags this accommodation down to one of the worst places I have ever stayed on my many travels to Pattaya. I couldn't and wouldn't recommend it to anyone as I myself will NEVER stay there again. So disappointing! JOHN J wrote a review Jul 2017\n",

      "50 Nice bar and restaurant with great staff This is a great bar and restaurant with some good food,cold drinks and very friendly staff.  This is a great bar, the music was never too loud, the beer was always cold plus there's beer on tap, a good selection of spirits, decent coffee and a pool table.  I tried a few dishes from the menu and was happy with all my selections plus they don't mind if you buy street food and bring it into the bar to eat. I found it a great place to start a night out or for an early morning finish.  I never stayed at the hotel but if it's run the same way as the bar it would be a good choice.  I look forward to coming back to this great place in May. Andrew B wrote a review Apr 2017\n"

      "20 So-so Nice place to sit and watch outside the restaurant. Ordered chicken wings (OK taste), lasagne (taste OK first then taste cold under the pasta) me and my husband sit longer because my husband's tummy reacted on his food (lasagne). He vomit twice and sweating no matter how windy it was and the fan was on. Maybe the food was not prepared well in the right temperature which my husband's tummy reacted.    You must not serve your lasagne. Synnøve thalia wrote a review Feb 2017\n",
      "50 Great for drinking and eating I ate and drank at the bar several times. The food was excellent but the Thai food could have been a bit more spicy. Best fries in the area and both Leo and Chang on tap. Overall a very nice place to sit and watch the world go by and be served very efficiently by a very nice staff. I did not stay at the hotel so I cannot rate it. Frank B wrote a review Jan 2017\n",
      "50 Great hotel, great people, affordable rates great experience The best place to stay in Pattaya. Harry, the owner, is great guy. He and his staff are always on the top of things to help you to make the most out of your vacations in Pattaya. My room was big one with nice window and balcony that is great to have a cold beer and enjoy the breeze. The pub and restaurant is great you don't have to go any where to meet new friends and have a great time. I have a great time the staff is very friendly and helpful, great location close to everything like the walking street, the beach, malls and anything you need. I personally recommed Harry his hotel and his staff. cheers montanasinger wrote a review Jan 2017\n",

      "40 Great place to meet up for Xmas lunch What a ripper place, great cold beer and great food, service really good, a good place to chill out and watch the day go by.  Love to go back again.  I did not stay in the hotel, but i think if the service is half as good as the bar, it would be good. 255100Scotty68 wrote a review Jan 2017\n",

      "50 Holiday I stayed at harrys from September to November, the place is spot on. I had a room with a balcony which was cleaned every day (if i got up in time) the bar was open 24/7. The food was really well coked and presented, and the staff i cant talk to highly off. That good im going back in February 2017. Only thing if the owner offers you one of his special drinks don't take it's disgusting and strong lol burtonlad wrote a review Dec 2016\n",

      "50 Outstanding value/ recommend First off, the food is awesome. The Swedish Meatballs are just like Sweden.  The hotel is close to the everything.  Little noisey depending on your room. There are rooms in the rear of property that are much more quiet then the main road facing balcony rooms  Big rooms with balcony are $17 night. Pool access next door for $3/day/person hard to beat value. Great staff and bar is open 24/7 Zack P wrote a review Aug 2016\n",
      "50 Great food, great straff a awesome customers This is the place to go if you want to experience great food, with their Scandinavian or rather Swedish dishes being outstanding. Great place to meetup. Not only a bunch of Swedes but English, Aussies and a few Yankees as well. Good place to start your evening. Reslimpan wrote a review Jun 2016\n",
      "40 Swedish food on Soi Diana Harry's Bar & Restaurant (on Soi Diana between Soi Bukhao and LK Metro) specializes in Swedish husmanskost (home cooking). Some of the dishes may not be familiar to non-Scandinavians, but all that I have had were tasty. There are a lot of dishes on the menu under 300 baht and every day a special for 195 baht. English and American breakfast is on offer, including steak and eggs. There are also some Thai dishes available. The service staff is friendly. I haven't stayed at the hotel.

      "50 Underrated This little sleeper is just what you need here. I'm guessing no one is booking Bua Khao for the view of the beach! Great Bar and restaurant on the first floor. English Breakfast is available.    The room is fresh and updated. The room safes don't work so if you need storage for an iPad you're busted.    Has a lift so that makes it much more valuable than most of the flats over this way. If the key thing bothers you just keep it! Just don't loose it! I'm sure that would cause a stir.    Every one of these LK style balcony buildings has an inherent security flaw insomuch as they can be breached by hopping from the adjacent balcony. Just don't come here with the crown jewels and make sure you lock the balcony sliding doors and enjoy!    The pool out the side door (100฿) raises it to the next level.    You are right at the mouth of LK Metro and a block off Soi Bua Khao. I paid 900฿ a night and I don't regret it. Made my visit very special. Iratdog wrote a review Mar 2016\n",
      "30 Room 307 Noisy This place used to called PS Apartments which is located next to the LK Metropole Hotel on Soi Diana. The rooms have recently been refurbished, bathroom re-tiled, and new sanitary-ware, shower installed. Good cable TV with a couple of English movie channels. On arrival the AC was making load noises and water dripping out of the unit. Informed the reception who quickly organised someone to fix it while I went out for something to eat upon returning it was repaired. They have safes in the room but no key given don't know why having to use the lockers at reception for my valuables. The security could be improved as your room key is left hanging on a board which is easily accessible to anyone using the toilet from the bar on the ground floor. Upon returning one night no one was on the reception (which is just a little table in the hallway) waited for a while for someone from bar staff to come but no one did as they were busy serving in the bar, so I just grabbed the keys myself which anyone could do and enter your room. They have got cctv in the the communal areas but that's no good if someone as already taken stuff from your room. Also if staying in room 307 and I assume it be the same in 207 & 407. It get noisy as there have a large 10\" extractor flue from the restaurant fixed to to outside wall. Which is constantly making a vibrating humming noise inside the rooms luckily the restaurant closes around midnight. This problem could easily be remedied by installing rubber pads to the mounting brackets of the extractor flue. All in all a cheap decent budget hote Stoney201 wrote a review Jan 2016\n",
      "10 Unfriendly staff, mediocre food and bad service. Came for lunch, staff took their time grabbing our order and were not kind when we did order, then forgot to put our order through. She came back 20 mins late probably when she realized she forgot to put our order through and told us it's so busy that's why our food was taking long. (There were 4 or 5 other tables of just drinks, so not busy) We waited 40 mins for 2 sandwiches, no apology and there was hair is my food. Don't waste your time here. The food is mediocre and the service is bad. deemach wrote a review Dec 2015\n",
      "50 Great place!! Great food, cold beer and friendly staff. You will never regret a visit here!! The rooms are new renovated, very fresh. And last, THE LOCATION is number 1!! Close to a great night life and about 300 m to the beach. About 200 m to shopping mall. ENJOY!! Calle B wrote a review Nov 2015\n"

      "50 Fabulous We came on Songtheaw from Pattaya which stops on the main road about 150m from property which is great.We were shown to our budget room which was on the 2nd floor, after 5 minutes the owner came and offered us an upgrade on the 1st floor for no extra charge.This place is the best we have stayed in on a low budget in the whole of Thailand for the last 2 months.The owner is just amazing will help you with anything even carried our backpacks to room for us. The standard of decor and cleanliness is excellent , and so is the price. Thankyou “Chilling Home” for our lovely stay. pam h wrote a review Feb 2019\n",
      "40 Great stay for value What I liked about the property was the location. Is was very convenient to have \"family mart\" a convenience store, a bus stop, and other shops with breakfast opportunities (now that the chilling home didn't have it) within 100meters/328feet.    One thing that was very nice was that they give you a new towel every day (I was only there for 2 nights so this is still to be confirmed), and a water bottle. There was also a fridge to store e.g. water, breakfast or other things. In the actual dorm (I was in the female dorm for 6 people), there were small chairs to sit on, a TV and AC.    A tip: Remember that you probably will be sharing the dorm and if you feel like the AC can be too cold or too hot then be strategic about which bed you choose.    One thing that the property doesn't have is a place to safe keep your personal belongings. Another tip is to bring a lock for your bag. Nonetheless, I still felt like I could trust the staff and left my computer in the room with absolutely no problems. Nadine A wrote a review Nov 2016\n",
      "40 We will be back for sure. The lady owner and his son were very kind. When we could not figure out how to reach their property, they offered to pick us up free of charge. They also helped us find a mini van who could take us to Trat so we could take the boat to Koh Chang. Motorcycle rental is really cheap too. You can also choose to travel around Pattaya with their free bicycles. TV has a lot of English channels. We will definitely come back here the next time we are in Pattaya.

      "50 great food, great service, great location!!! i come to pattaya twice a year, every year.  this is my hotel/restraunt of choice.    i usually stay for 10 days at a nearby villa, for breakfast/lunch/dinner the patamnak guesthouse is where my friends and i eat.    they also deliver, we throw pool parties at 3 nites a week while staying in pattaya and as i mentioned we call and order party platters of food and they ALWAYS come through.    if you're ever in pattaya and you need an inexpensive place to stay or searching for a good meal.    make sure you stop by the patamnak guesthouse! ford h wrote a review Feb 2017\n",

      "50 Great place to stay! This place is just perfect, very clean and the rooms are very well organized. The balconies are a Plus to enjoy the view and a drink over the street. Quiet, clean, very functional, new, the price is very valuable for this Guest House.  The staff is friendly and polite, the food in the restaurant downstairs is good especially the desserts! They also make Pizzas and that give a good smell when you are at the balcony of your room!  The beach is a few steps from here and the city center a bit further but not too far.  Just go for it.

      "40 Guest House or Hotel? Well what do I say about this place It is located on the left hand side of Soi 5 as you go down the hill & not as shown on google maps.  I’ll start with our arrival.  Arrived around 8pm & met by a friendly member of staff who booked us into room 7 on the second floor. By the way, there is no lift in this place.  Everything looked OK so nothing more to report.  The second day started OK but we noticed a bad smell coming from the bathroom. Drains seemed to be the problem, so off to reception to complain about it. Not a problem they moved us to room 8. Great No smell. ( I noticed that room 7 was available the following day with no work done on the drain smell) I thought the new room OK but my girlfriend didn’t think it was that clean. She pointed out hair behind the sink in the bathroom & a little dust under the bed. The only thing I didn’t like was that the bathroom floor remained wet after taking a shower, The bathroom is a wet room with the floor having little or no drop to the drain.  The location is just fine. About 200mts from the beach.  It has its own Bars & Restaurant which seemed very popular. There are many more bars on both sides of the road.  Staff where very friendly & helpful.  I would say, it’s good value for money but just needs a few things sorting out. It is listed as a Guest house and not a Hotel. But I think standards should be just as high, no matter what it’s called.  So would I use this place again. Yes is the answer.  All I can say is give it a try & make up your own mind. It’s not that bad. It’s a lot better than some hotels in the area. GTRMax wrote a review Oct 2016\n",
      "50 Very nice hotel. A nice and friendly hotel. The room and restaurant is very clean and the staff is very service minded. You get top service all the time. Very good prices, both for room and in the restaurant.  You have access to laundry and car/motorbike rental.  The restaurant is excellent, and have all the dishes you want, both Thai and western style. You must taste the pizza, the best in town, I think.  The location is good, quiet and friendly, only 5 min walk from a good beach. hallgeir2016 wrote a review Oct 2016\n"

      "50 Nice stay again I was not expecting such a good hotel for this price but what a good surprise :-)  Thanks to my friend who advised me the first time I went to Thailand.  A warm and welcoming staff with little attentions to make your stay the most agreable.  Pizze even better than in some italian restaurants! And Mam knows, with her thai food how to manage to make sure you will be back soon... Marc B wrote a review Aug 2016\n",

      "50 One of the most friendly hotels Cheap friendly clean and close to the beach and town. Mam the manager was great at English and would help you in anyway she can. My and my girlfriend stayed there July and even booked an extra day. She sorted our quad biking and printing off sheets we needed and let us use Her phone to sort our flights out. I highly recommend this place. Also best place for a scooter. Many thanks Chris and Sarah Chris S wrote a review Jul 2016\n",
      "40 Spotlessly clean and a lovely location We loved our 2 night stay at the Patamnak Beach Guest House at Soi 5. It was barely 150 metres from the beach and the vibe about the place and surroundings was so charming.  The apartment was spacious and very comfortable for the 3 of us. The microwave and refrigerator are provided in the kitchenette and you have to request for cutlery and crockery. Both the air-con units (in the bedroom and above the sofa cum bed in the hall) worked well and the fans were an additional bonus.  The place is clean although we experienced a temporary whiff of foul smell that was rectified soon.  The staff that man the restaurant double up for maintenance of the apartments.  Guests at the property enjoy a discount on massages at the Lotus Massage across the road. Bicycles and scooters are available on hire across the road.  From this location, you pay around 250-300 baht for the taxi to Pattaya Central.  The restaurant serves a limited but tasty Thai and Italian menu! My boys enjoyed the pizzas that were so tasty!

      "50 Fantastic place Came for a weekend trip and needed a place for the night. Was very comfortable, slept well and all the staff were extremely friendly! Nice a quiet area and easy to find.    The food was absolutely amazing too!!!    We left Saturday morning to go to Ko Larn and when we got there I realised I forgot to checkout and I still had the key! I rang the lady and she was very understanding and was happy for us to return the key the following day which we did. We therefore decided to have pizza and a salad and it was so good. Best salad I've had in Thailand and I've been here since September! Luke F wrote a review Apr 2016\n",
      "50 It's Worth It Clearly one of the best place to stay outside of city center of Pattaya.  Brand new hotel and restaurant.  Great staff, beach is only 5 minutes down the street.  Amenities are new and awesome for this price.  We'll come back again soon Iztkombi1 wrote a review Mar 2016\n",

      "30 Noisy area. Booked with Orbitz .com-- check in easy, room ready. We were on 2nd floor- 2 rooms. King bet, air, reasonable size, toilet good, tv, wi fi, balcony with no view. Overall room was good for price but at night noisy from activities in the soi. The swimming pool was great, Room servicing was good. Photos on internet are a little outdated. Room rate around 25 australian dollars per night. There are better rooms than the ones we had. Location is good for action seekers. Garry B wrote a review Mar 2020\n",
      "20 Really disappointing The Sutus Court complex is in an excellent location if you like good cheap restaurants, plenty of places for a drink, easy access to transport and a short walk to the beach.  The check-in process was fine but that was about it. I was given a room on the 4th floor,which was fine to try and cut down on road noise, but no-one mentioned there's no elevator in that building,so me and the hotel employee had to carry the bags up several flights of stairs. We got to a room that was literally right under the roof.That is, the ceiling had a slope on it which meant things like using the mirror were impossible and it was a bit of a contortion to use the toilet.  The room itself had dated 70's decor, though the toilet had been replaced. There was no soap holder, the TV was new 20 years ago, the internet didn't work for a full day and neither did the phone when I rang up to ask about the internet! To cap it off,there were ants..... lots and lots of ants so putting rubbish into the smallest rubbish bin in Thailand was an excuse for the ants to come and visit.  I will use this complex again for all the reasons mentioned but will not use this hotel. It was a disappointing stay. hoges1959 wrote a review Dec 2019\n",
      "40 Value for money Clean room and convenient location with 7 eleven, family mart, eateries, pubs, massage parlours all within walking distance. Towels are provided, refrigerator but no bath room kits. Bring your own.  Overall it is a pleasant stay for the amount we pay, it is worth it/ JinTan2019 wrote a review May 2019\n",
      "40 We would return.. Good location, close to pubs, bars, shops and market, 10-15 mins by foot to get to Walking street. Great value for money and even if the building is a bit old, it was clean. Loved the swimming pools and we enjoyed our stay here. Eve E wrote a review Jan 2017\n",
      "40 On a budget - this could be the place This hotel offers customers a great choice from their larger roomed Sutus Court 1 to the lower priced but smaller units all located in adjacent buildings around the communal pool and car park.  This time, I stayed in Sutus Court 2 which is the second most expensive rooms they have available. Still good value though.  Approached through SC1 over a flat roof with pretty steep ramps which are very slippery when wet, pass the inviting jacuzzi and you are in your allocated room.  It does offer all the usual facilities but to be honest, they are tired and outdated and could do with replacement. That said, you get what you pay for and this option is both cheap and more than adequate for a few nights stay.    The Sutus Court buildings are well located on Buakhao with great restaurants on your doorstep. There is a decent sized car park although this can get full, pleasant enough staff except at night when they get out the grumpy versions and an acceptable coffee shop which all feature the statutory old experts on everything that is wrong with Thailand - You have met them!  All in all, this is a decent place to park your head during your trip to Pattaya. Jim H wrote a review Sep 2016\n",
      "40 I like No 2 I have stayed in 1,2 and 4 Sutus Court No 1 to many bagging doors. Sutus Court 2 is my Favorite quiet no bagging doors cost less than 1, Sutus court 4 very quiet if you like that it's away from everything. Staff are very good safety deposit boxes available just basic place to stay clean rooms Air Con for the price it OK Alfio G wrote a review Aug 2016\n",
      "40 Good central hotel I've stayed here several times in Sutus 1,2 and 5 all rooms were clean with good air con and fan , tv , free wifi and good bathrooms .  Although some of the rooms may not be the most modern I think that reflects on the price .  On first floor they have quite A big jacuzzi and on ground floor big pool both are well kept and clean .  I noticed during my stay the staff come out at about 5 am and everything is cleaned and brushed floors , chairs ,tables and pathways .......spotless  Also has ample free parking for residents which is good in that area !  I will stay again on my next visit Dave the nomad wrote a review Jul 2016\n",
      "20 ''So so'' Room towel is old and dirty and unfriendly staff. However the location is very convenient to a night life a lot of bars around the area and walk 30 minutes to the pier station.    Swimming are good but not really clean. Rodroblevy T wrote a review May 2016\n",
      "50 Great value It was my first time in Pattaya.  I booked this hotel for 5 nights.  I didnt know where I was going.    Despite of this hotel has got just one star., i spent a nice time in this hotel.    All is clean. Maybe they need to be renovated .but bed was good. And my opinion is the follow.. if U sleep well holiday are good.    Swimming is very good. Just tipy that dont have more place at the pool and something to be protect of the sun.    Hotel is not far away from everything.    Hotel can arrange U excursion with good price.    Please note that in case of you broke a glass, a bridge , mirror , U should paid....

      "40 Big Rooms I like Sutus court 2, I made the mistake of upgrading to Sutus court 1, it was very noise and people banging doors at all hour, because it has an in closed hall way you hear every sound, I will go back to Sutus court 2 as there is none of that there. alfmaz wrote a review Apr 2016\n"

      "20 Not what we expected The room was very clean and nice. The WiFi was absolutely terrible every 5 minutes you had to log in that's if you could log in the signal was terrible. The front of house staff were friendly but struggled with speaking or understanding English. This hotel seemed to cater for the Japanese . Breakfast was the worst we have ever had. Everything was cold even the fried eggs. We asked for fresh one to be told NO! Again breakfast catered for the Japanese. The pool area was very hot with only 2 sun beds and 2 tables with 4 chairs on each. To get into the pool you had to go down a ladder at the deep end so if you was not a confident swimmer you would struggle. There was no shade at all in this area. We will not be returning to this hotel. sue n wrote a review May 2019\n",

When we reach their sister property, we realise actually we book is the first hotel we go.    Hotel assign shuttle to us back to that first hotel.

Location is goods, near nightclub and restaurant. But it would be convenience if you have private car. Proud S wrote a review Feb 2016\n"

      "50 Small, Cosy, and Warm Resort at Koh Larn When my friends and me decided to go to Koh Larn, we could not choose where to stay because it has a lot of resorts and hotels there. So we just randomly picked one from the internet and it was Baan Manow Resort. We were there for 2 nights. It was uncrowded place. So you can be super chill as you want. It costed only 1,290 baht/night/2 persons plus 300 baht for extra person. This place was not far from Nuan beach and Ta Yai beach. The staffs were very friendly. Even their pets were also nice! For seafood lovers who want to party, there are places for BBQ. You can buy fresh seafoods from market and the staff will set up a charcoal BBQ and set the table for you. Thing that I liked the most was that they paid attention to even the smallest deatail. For example, when you arrive there, you I will see not only 2 bottles of water in the fridge like in other hotels but also Pipo jellies there. Isn't it cute ? If it is, next time when you go to Koh Larn. I suggest you try Baan Manow. Nalin N wrote a review Feb 2016\n"

      "40 Great 4 beds in 1 room deal! We were a group of 8 and needed a great value for money place, where we would all be able to hang out. We paid around 600-700 baht each for the room. They offer a room where 4 people can sleep. 2 twin beds on the bottom floor and they had like an adult bunk bed situation on top. Very comfortable, very clean.    Overall a pleasant stay, 3 min walk to the quiet Jomtien beach. Only 20 min 10 baht ride with the \"song taew\" trucks. Michelle L wrote a review Jul 2020\n",

      "40 Quality boutique hotel... Stayed here for 7 nights.. reception staff minimal English but very nice.  Only booked regular room which is small and the balcony view is a wall.  Decided to move to\"seaview room\".... slightly bigger with a limited sea view, the whole top floor.. level 5 was vacant... but they still wanted 3500thb for the upgrade..i got it down to 3000thb,  Anyway i paid the 3000thb... the room is nice... the bed is super comfortable... probably 5 star bedding.  Tv channels are good and WiFi strong.  Maids do a good job and there is not much to complain about.  I stayed 7 nights and did not see a single other guest my whole stay....wierd.... the pool is small and i never used it.... bad design has a metal frame above the pool where numerous birds spend there time... leaving their waste in the pool below...  The gym is comical... but there are local gyms for cheap in the area.... soi 3 i think... old but gets the job done.  Beach is 1 minute walk... where you can get baht bus to anywhere.  Laundry is next door.  Family mart end of street.  Good quality boutique hotel.  Quiet and comfortable.  Think i had best room in hotel due to paying for the upgrade.  However due to the place being empty, a free upgrade would have went a long way to me returning to this hotel.  To summarise.... Quality hotel.....ok staff.... not bad location... terrible gym....un inviting swimming pool.  Would have stayed longer but still a bit annoyed that an empty hotel cannot offer guests free upgrades.  Won't be returning to this hotel.  I think now hotel a few metres from here would be a better choice.  My opinion only..... Terry M wrote a review Sep 2018\n",
      "20 Nice in photos but not in reality. Front desk rude, breakfast dubious. I am keen to give hotels a chance but it seems this one deserves a review that is honest but not necessarily good.  The positives are comfortable bed and clean rooms. However the negatives far out way those and the main one is customer service. The female manager was very abrupt and had no idea how to deal with customers. I do not feel the need to go into detail but she was just moody and I felt she was in the wrong job. I know breakfast is hot and miss in any hotel in Asia that isn’t a 5 star and only costs a few dollars but this was a joke. I really don’t why it is so hard to make a good breakfast buffet. Another thing that needs addressing is the waste pipes in our room were exposed and came through the ceiling so every time someone flushed the toilet above you can hear the lovely sound effects of this.  A small but silly design fault is no light switches by the bed so you have to get out of bed and turn the lights on or off???  If you read this and still want to book I recommend being cautious and trying the place out for one night first. SteliosUk wrote a review Jan 2018\n",
      "50 Good choice The hotel was really good. The area is not that sparkling like the center but transportation is so easy there. The beach is 40 seconds walk. Hotel is clean and quiet. Staff is helpful. Pool is small but really clean and good temperature. Small shops and restaurants nearby. 279gabork wrote a review Nov 2017\n",
      "40 Thailand Province themed boutique hotel The room is really clean and renovated with style. Bedding is clean and mattress is comfortable. How I wish that is my room.... The hotel even provide Supper meal...that is sweet. No nice view from the balcony but the polite staffs and 50m away from the beach is plus point. Price inclusive of Ala carte Breakfast and Supper is economy. A small gym and swimming pool for sun bathing. Definately recommend to friends to stay. I will stay this hotel whenever in Pattaya. edmundlew1969 wrote a review Jul 2017\n",

Overall good for rooms however location and Resturant is not that great. Kuldeep B wrote a review May 2017\n",
      "40 Modern hotel I stayed 10 nights and experienced an extremely nice reception. Room was clean and comfortable. Insolation between rooms could be better. Breakfast was ok, but for this long stay it became a little dull. I signed up for a room with seaview, but the distance is too far and with buildings between you hardly see the ocean. Anyway it is a quiet street and only 3 minutes walk to the beach. Engel47 wrote a review Mar 2017\n"

      "40 Great hotel 30 min to central Pattaya The hotel is an excellent value for the money. I paid less than $30USD per night for a \"sea view room\". Was not given the balcony as booked. Seems to be an issue for people who book with Agoda (booking website, should have booked through Trip Advisor LOL) not getting as good a room as booked. Staff were friendly and went out of their way to try to make sure I was happy. (The balcony was not a big deal to me as I don't smoke). The only disappointment was the distance to Pattaya. Its about 30 minutes by local taxi with all the traffic and stops that they make but its still only 10 Baht. You can't go wrong. The hotel design is great and you really feel at home. Everything was in working order. If I wanted to stay in that area this hotel would be my first choice. Mark B wrote a review Mar 2017\n",
      "40 Funky smaller boutique hotel, just off the beach front. We really enjoyed our week long stay here. Certainly on of the nicest we have stayed in in Asia, irrespective of prices (which was pretty reasonable).    This boutique hotel has really interesting decor...with many rooms decorated differently. We loved ours, that had a kind of industrial/warehouse feel to it.    Beds/pillows/linen are excellent, and general condition of the property is excellent being very new.    The pool is located on the first floor balcony, which is a bit different, but is clean and usable, even if the views aren't special.    Breakfast was a combination of European and Asian dishes,and whilst the selection wasnt enormous (to be expected in a smaller hotel), it was entirely adequate and well prepared.    Location.....we actually liked that it was 100m back from Jomtien Beach Rd, which gets crazy busy over the weekends.    Other amenities - there is food available during limited hours fr o m the downstairs restaurant. Cant comment on this as we didnt eat there, but it appeared very quiet. Probably a difficult thing for a place this size to manage given the literally hundreds of options for dining in Jomtien. There is no bar service to the pool area. No room service available. Both of these comments are made as reference for others only, not criticisms.....being a small boutique establishment, they would be unrealistic expectations.    We would certainly stay here again! TonynNadine wrote a review Jan 2017\n",
      "40 Good start but disappointing end. When we arrived at the hotel the staff was very helpful and friendly. We got offered some fresh juice and a coupon for a free supper at the restaurant. First day we didn't get a breakfast buffet but we had to choose from the menu what we wanted. Second day the buffet was very good with enough variety. When we wanted to go for our free supper, they told us we could only eat between 9 and 11 pm. So we waited until 9, at 9.30 we finally got our food: a cup of bouillon soup... We went afterwards to the night market for some more food. When we wanted to check out, the guy at the desk shoved his cellphone into my face with the question if I broke a glass. (The whole staff speaks bad English) The cleaning lady even ran downstairs to show me the glass I broke... I felt like a criminal for breaking a glass and they charged us 200 bath for it. So, not my best stay yet. Nice rooms though. Fvanneck wrote a review Dec 2016\n",

      "50 Cute Trendy Boutique Hotel Very close to Jomtien beach which is much quieter than the main Pattaya Strip. Very cute hotel. The rooms decorations are beautiful with a vintage bathroom look. Lights are very charming and placed thoughtfully throughout the room. We got upgraded to a city view room and the balcony is quite nice for to drink coffee outside. The property is quite new and seems to have the guest in mind. The bed has light switches and outlets for both sleeping parties. Nice robes and slippers. Overall a wonderful place to say! Value it very good as well! Only downside is parking is a little bit down the street and their is now shower curtin so water may go around the bathroom. Edward J wrote a review Jun 2016\n"

      "20 NO Quality NO Hill We were very excited as for the first time we are visiting to Pattaya and had very high expectation in terms of quality hotels and services but the moment we land up in Quality Resort at Pattaya Hill all our expectations shattered from hill to deep in the sea of Pattaya. ohhhh my god it is one of the most terrible RCI affiliated resort in the world I guess. There is no body to pick up the luggage we carried our selves. No one was there in the reception counter we had to wait about 20 minutes to search some body who can find the receptionist finally she appeared with no smile. After the check in formalities we found that its a one man sorry one woman show as there is no male staff in the hotel you must be wondering how so listen sorry read there is hardly any staff in the hotel receptionist does all the work like picking the luggage, room service, house keeping etc. This is the first time ever We come across such experience. Hotel lobby is big but decor is poor , rooms are terrible, there is no room service. you have to order some out side restaurants to deliver the food. if you need drinking water or tea forget it you have go out and buy yourself. As far as facilities in the hotel are concern there is swimming pool, massage parlor, a store, travel desk and small restaurant. Now come to the bottom line if wish to dump your hard earned money in to the pattaya sea always stay here in Quality Resort at Pattaya Hill. RCMSANJEEV wrote a review Mar 2013\n",
      "40 Hotel with a view This resort is located at the pattya hill... the view from the roof top resturant at 22nd floor is magnificent.  The resort is self contained with a small convenience store and a resturant. Taxis are avilable just outside the resort. Tuk-Tuks are avialbleon the main road.    The room is good and quite clean. Facilitieslike micro wave oven etc makes small meal preparation possible.  The staff are very helpful.  Good experience plpalani wrote a review Feb 2013\n",
      "40 Very Friendly Staff especially Ms Tin We spent 4 days at the place. The resort is approx couple of Kms from both Pattaya Beach as well as Jomtien beach, and it takes 100 bahts to go to either from this place. The front staff comprising of ever smiling Ms Tin (I hope I have written the name right) is great. Kitchenette was a great help, we being vegetarian. Better to take packages for Nong Nooch, Coral Island from reception itself rather than searching yourself. They are reasonable ones - not too different from what you get elsewhere. Alok.Wadehra wrote a review Jan 2013\n",
      "40 Higher than expectations... After reading all the horrible reviews before mine, I thought I was in for trouble from my very finicky wife and always-cribbing kids...  BIG RELIEF! Decent hotel... esp after the expectations had gone abysmally low.  Avg on cleanliness, average facilities, decent and polite staff, nice pool, room facilities just the way I wanted.  The layout was the hotel was strange but that was just about the negative I could see.  Location was a little wayward, but actually a little more convenient if u have to go to the pier to catch the ferry to Pattaya or to walking street... 25B per head each way if you can catch the shared cab or 100B if you hire a cab for yourself.    The coffee shop was a trifle sparse; the small store at the lobby level was well stocked for any snacks or odds and ends to be picked up in case of emergency.    On the whole, if you're at Pattaya for fun and need a simple, neat n clean place with no frills where you'll simply go back to, for sleeping, then this is it. ManishR_11 wrote a review Dec 2012\n",
      "30 Average resort in not so great location This resort appears pretty average and even location is quite odd. Lobby looks ordinary though pool side is not too bad.    Rooms are small and very congested bathroom is really bad.    Restaurant in top floor provides awsome view of pattaya in night and also offers great oriental food . dmmr6163 wrote a review Apr 2011\n",
      "40 good value for money We stayed at Quality resort at Pattaya hill for the week end. We had a huge suite of two bedrooms and a living room with a wonderful view on the hill & forest. The swimming pool is very large, great if you want to do some exercise. The only drawback is that we were a bit far from Jomtien beach and had to take a tuk-tuk (song tao) to get to Jomtien beach or to any restaurant. But it is definitely a great place to go for the week end (from Bangkok). valschmitt wrote a review Feb 2011\n",
      "30 Easy stay for weekend from Bangkok Good value for easy-stay residence for weekend from bangkok. Suit for those who just want to have good price but standard quality hotel for do activities outside hotel at day time in Pattaya. It can give you a little relaxing time at evening at swimming pool. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Jan 2010\n",
      "20 Average experience. we stayed with my kid and wife for 3 nights at the resort. there was no view as we were on 3rd floor.  pros - very spacious room size, big bed, nice swimming pool, very co-operative saff and restaurant staff for making things vegetarian for us.  cons - very old furniture, needs desparate renovation, very far from pattayya beach, payed 100 bahts each time each way to and fro to the beach for taxi, not very clean, dull place. a typical rci property. Ashish S wrote a review Jan 2010\n",
      "40 hilltop view Good facilities: pool, cushioned loungers, gym, table tennis, snooker etc. Internet available, shop, lounge with t.v., newspapers. Staff o.k. Nice guy salutes when opens llift for you! Room decent, slightly rundown, but kettle for tea/coffee, good balcony, table and chairs. Nearby attraction is Big Buddha, still a hard walk in the heat. Taxis available for downtown, 100 baht. Quite an extensive lobby area with restaurant. Another restaurant on top floor with great views! All in all, good value, just a tough mile walk back up the hill! A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Dec 2009\n",
      "40 pattaya hill i have to say i was quite happy with my stay in this hotel - the rooms are more like appartment than actual rooms with aall the amenites one would require - for the price one cant beat it - its walking distance to walking street - about 10 - 15 mins. all in all, i must say, a thumbs up for me.

      "50 Great value in a quiet location not far away The Quality Resort @ Pattaya Hill is a fantastic value. The rooms are big with nice views in all directions. The swimming pool is big and very clean. My standard room had a TV with many cable channels to choose from and a hot water maker for coffee, tea, or instant noodles. The A/C works well. The bathroom is also good size. The security in the Quality Resort is excellent. The security guard gives you a salute and a big smile each time you enter an elevator from the lobby. Although the Quality Resort is not within walking distance of the primary tourist area, taxis and motorcycle taxis are readily available. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Nov 2009\n",
      "40 Pleasant Hotel I found the hotel to be a pleasant surprise. The air conditioning was a little load but this had the effect of isolating any other noise. Slept well, since undisturbed, every night. Baht buses within walking distance, although some people may regard the distance as a problem. I extended my stay by an extra night and intend to stay there again. The only point I would make is that the standard charge for the hotel is a little on the high side for Pattaya, but if you get a discounted deal then it is a good hotel for the price. Taxi service outside hotel was cheap by Pattaya standards and I used them regularly. Normally stay in Jomtien with my wife as Jomtien better for families compared to Pattaya itself. This is a hotel where I would not have any problem taking my wife and family. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Oct 2009\n",
      "40 Nice for the price It is one of the tallest buildings in the area and built on a hill to begin with add up to great views of the area. Room is nice enough, tile floor. A quiet condo building with good security and friendly staff. Good covered parking. The swimming pool area is nice and clean but a little small for the number of residents. Pool is shallow; the deep end would only be shoulder level for most adults. Travel agent, mini mart and other convenient services available on the ground floor. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Oct 2009\n",
      "40 A bit older but still nice Our room was a bit old and worn but not too bad. The room amenities called for a microwave oven however, none in our room. The hotel is located on a hill with a park nearby so nice views and surroundings. There is a local temple with a large golden Buda image nearby also. Baht bus routes (local public transportation) are too far to comfortably walk to in the blinding Thai sun. High marks for the friendly and helpful staff. Did not eat at the downstairs restaurant but in looked clean with a nice menu.    Overall a good experience. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Oct 2009\n",
      "40 Good value This is a condo building with two separate operators who control several rooms to run as a hotel. The property is much older than it appears in website pictures. However, it is generally clean and well maintained (some minor problems in our room).  The location is both a pro and con depending on what you are looking for. It is quiet and peaceful compared to most of Pattaya. However, far from attractions and nightlife, contrary to what the hotel says it is far and inconvenient from public transportation routes. More suited for someone with their own transportation (car or motorbike) or families who want to hang around the pool, etc. Overall, a good value given the low price. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Oct 2009\n",
      "40 Very Quiet Isolated midway between Pattaya & Jomtien. Ideal if you want peace and quiet, a very cheap well run hotel clean large rooms good service from friendly staff. BRGPlymouth wrote a review Aug 2009\n",
      "40 Quite and comfortable I booked this through Club Mahindra Holiday share and was staying in the month of May along with my wife and two kids (5 & 10) from 21st May onwards for 3 nights.    The place is very centrally located and is having excellent connectivity to two main areas of Pattaya i.e. South Pattaya and Jomitan beach. Local transport tempoos take just 5 minutes to any direction and charge just 10 Baht per person.    The place is very quite and very neat and clean. The housekeeping is excellent and reception is also very friendly. A grocery shop on ground floor has most of the daily need items. saurabha_in wrote a review Jun 2009\n",
      "40 Great views and time to relax Firstly, this resort is also listed as Pattaya Hill Resort. Same pool pictures but different address. We arrived the day that the Aseaian Summit was being bombarded by the red shirts and our driver who we booked through Oriental Escape (highly recommended) had all sorts of problems getting us to the resort. All roads were blocked by police. He hired a motorbike taxi for 40BHT and we went through some back streets to get there. We were only about 400mtr from the summit. There were police personal everywhere. When we checked in we were warmly welcomed and made to feel safe straight away. The day after when all the red shirts went back to Bangkok, all the staff we delighted and so were we. We were in Pattaya during Songkrah and would highly recommend a visit during April. We all had a ball. We had to buy our kids some water pistols so they had some amunition as each night coming back from Pattaya in a Songtel (about 150BHT) we got drenched. At least they could get some revenge with their own water spray. The walk upto the big Budda and Chinese gardens was well worth it. Only 5 min. We used the little mini mart to get fresh milk and ice creams each night and bought our drinks while we were in Pattaya. The massage place at the hotel was awesome. Every night, we all (5 of us. 2 adults 3 kids) had either a foot massage, thai massage or oil massage. They loved my kids and nothing was ever a problem for them. They open from 10am til midnight which was great, as most nights were didn't get back until 10.30pm. The internet was 50BHT for 1 hour 7 min which wasn't too bad. The food in the cafe was fresh and reasonably priced although a little slow. We ate there the first night and our last night, mainly for convenience. The only real down side was we felt the travel/tour organiser at the resort was usually more interested in picking her face or doing her nails than she was with helping. We found that information had to be asked for and was not freely given. The mini kitchen was very very basic. A water boiler and fridge. Not that it was a big deal considering it was actually cheaper for us to eat out than to think about cooking. The view from our room was spectacular. The pool was also great with 2 small pools by the side just to sit in and relax. AdelaideFamilyof5 wrote a review Apr 2009\n",
      "50 Liked the pool This resort is strategically placed at the top of pattaya hill. well i can say midway to jomtien beach & pattaya city.  A walk around the hotel leads you up to the Buddha temple at the top of the hill, where they have a local FM station also.    5 minutes to one-side is the city road which leads to walking street , beach front - for boat rides etc.    While 5 minutes to the other side leads you to Jomtien Beach.    The snooker table was although not upto mark, but hey for vacation lover's it was at par. They do have a nice pool which gives a kinda of horizon view of the entire city of Pattaya. Room where well maintained with even a terrace and complete kitchen to cook your own food.. Worth the price. Vikas C wrote a review Apr 2009\n"

      "50 Always happy at Neta hotel I've stayed at Neta hotel 5 times over the past 7 months, and I am always happy with my stay.  The receptionist is a lovely woman ,who is always very helpful ,and speaks good English. The staff are also very friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean and spacious. The location of the hotel is only a walk away from restaurants, 7-11 , taxis and The Avenue. The swimming pool is perfect on a hot day too.. I looked forward to my next visit to Neta Hotel, Pattaya    Thankyou Neta Hotel    Kind regards    Teacher William Barney wrote a review Apr 2021\n",

Room cleaning service was very quick and thorough, I always left a tip on the bed. Awesome central location to everything we needed. As well as an eatery next door (not the hotel) and 7/11 only around the corner. Pool was slightly above par to hotel, that was good and refreshing. A side from that, you get what you paid for.

Breakfast is ok. That's all the good points. Hotel is quite old. Shower water pressure is very low. Has never been a big fan of a bath tub, less one without a hand shower.

      "40 One month stay at the Neta hotel Hotel is in a good location close to second road, Avenue shops, beach road and Soi Bukhou. Soi Buhhaou market is a short 15 minute walk away. Pool was adequate, rooms were a good size with small balcony facing side street or pool area. House keeping was daily with good service. Food was good although we did not have the daily breakfast only ordered pool side food several times. The price is very good for what is on offer. We usually stay at a higher priced hotel and this time we chose a cheaper hotel and were very surprised with the quality and service. The only gripe was from the wife she was disappointed that there was no cable TV only local with 2 English speaking channels (mainly world news). Wasn't a problem for me as I did not go there to watch TV. Would highly recommend this hotel for the budget conscious travellers. We recommended this hotel to my son based on our stay and he is visiting in October this year for 2 weeks. We stayed for a month and were highly satisfied. Well done to all the staff.

Even they know that there were some vegetarian Indians were staying, they haven't kept any thing vegetarian. Even after telling them.    We reached early and even though they have vacant room, they had not given us that and kept us waiting for more than 3 hours.    Staff understand English but pretends that they don't. When they want to communicate they do.    So my recommendation for Indians and specially vegetarian, not to stay there. Bharat C wrote a review Aug 2018\n",

However the breakfast was included and was good. Rooms are very spacious too. There was a swimming pool which again was a bit murky so I avoided that. The best thing is the low and budget friendly price and also the peaceful ambiance.This hotel is not on any busy road. Its about 7 to 8 minutes walk away from Soi Bukhao.

I wish during construction they had insulated walls, floors better for noise. Other than thoughtless guests having loud half hour conversations in passageways at 4 am it was great.

      "50 Good Value of Money Good Hotel & Friendly staffs. Will definitely visit again. I loved this place as the rooms are big & balcony. Not very far from popular walking street. 7/11 is 5 minutes walking distance. This hotel is good value of money. Md. Sohel Khan wrote a review Jan 2017\n",
      "10 Inept Management Firstly, let me emphatically say: the name of this hotel is a joke. It is so far removed from the concept of a resort that I am embarrassed for the management. Speaking of the management, due to unresolved issues I asked to see the Manager. \"Him not in\" was indicative of the poor standard of English proffered from the staff. Asking the designation of this staff member with barely adequate English, the lady told me she was the assistant Manager and the most senior staff member available. However, her rudeness and inability to offer any resolution to my legitimate concerns introduced me to the poorest level of managerial service I have ever witnessed in 20 plus years of regular international travel. Suffice to say, the Neta \"Resort\" will never be graced with my presence again. They should change their name to Neta Rort. MurrayIsMyName wrote a review Jan 2017\n"

      "40 Wonderful experience, great hospitality. We had stayed at Neta Resorts, which was only 1.5 KMs away from the Beach Road and Walking street, the heart of Pattaya. The rooms were clean and the bed always made whenever we returned. However, the pool was too deep (8-9 feet) for everyone to swim and the Air Conditioners were small (1 ton) for the spacious rooms.  Complimentary Breakfast didn't have much options, but nevertheless it was delicious. Rahul D wrote a review Jun 2016\n",

Not sufficient cooling.  Language problem, they cant communicate in even basic English.  Very limited breakfast option and almost no option for vegetarian person except fruits.  Very stiff beds.  Construction work is going on there so noise of drilling & other sounds come all day till evening.    Rooms service persons were very courteous but at reception you would feel the rudeness.

The mattresses and pillows are not comfortable, too hard to sleep. The cupboards are dusty and hangers are spoilt. The location is a little remote, have to walk out quite a distance to shops. The toilet is using shower head stick onto the wall, there is no curtain to prevent water from making the floor wet. The water in the shower Is not warm enough. The wifi is quite slow. teo852 wrote a review Mar 2016\n",

You can take hot water to the room, a thermos is available in the room. Wi-Fi isn't very fast. The furniture is new and clean. Recommended if you want to stay in the urban zone.

      "40 A nice place to stay in central Pattaya I have visited this place for three times already. It's a nice, simple, quiet hotel located in central Pattaya near the Second road. A short time ago the hotel was renovated and renamed to Neta Resort. Now it has a new laminated floor in each room, clean bathroom and a big LED TV. Also there is a small fridge and a free safebox in the room. All the rooms are big and have a balcony. The hotel has its own small swimming pool. Friendly staff, ready to help, my room was always clean, free WI-FI is available everywhere which is convenient. It's easy to get everywhere you need on a tuk-tuk or a motorbike taxi at any time of day and night. If you have a single accomodation, the hotel doesn't charge any money for your guests. But there are also some defects - poor breakfast, very small dining room, and sometimes it was noisy from the construction site which is near the hotel. But anyway, thanks to the staff for my great holiday! artemf702 wrote a review Oct 2015\n"

      "40 Clean & Nice budget Hotel The Hotel was neat & clean and very well maintained. The hotel is 500m away from the main road inside a side street (soi) & approx. 1.5 km away from walking street but nevertheless very much approachable with massage parlours & restaurant on the main road which are open until late night. The only negative point, was the entry street to the hotel which had garbage pile with rain waterlogged on street, producing unbearable foul odour.    The reception staff was hospitable, helpful & smiling pleasantly. They were at times unable to provide directions or attractions to visit, evidently due to weak English skills but not a negative factor.    I stayed in superior room, everything was good about it.  The breakfast was limited for vegetarians with pork & beef as main constituent. I would advice not to avail breakfast while booking room, if you seek veggie diet.  Overall, value for money budget hotel. ramawat wrote a review Oct 2015\n",

The room looked modern and clean with all we needed - new TV, safe, clean furniture, air conditioning, etc.    We had no problems with the service, and will definitely be returning to stay here again.

      "10 Possibly the most uncomfortable hotel i've ever stayed in The staff are friendly enough, the rooms are quite big. The aircons are far too small for the size of the rooms and thus don't supply enough cool air. The beds are like sleeping on a concrete slab. The power points seem to have a mind of their own and appliances have to be continuously re inserted to work, including the bar fridge. The shower has to run for 10 minutes before you get any hot water, and if there is more than a couple of people using the water supply at the same time, it comes out in a trickle. There is a new hotel being built across the road so don't expect to sleep in past 07:30. Oh and did I mention the beds are so uncomfortable you have to be totally exhausted to be able to get any sleep in them. The supposed coffee shop is never manned after breakfast and if you want any lunch {or god forbid dinner} you have to virtuously drag the receptionist away to get you the scant menu that's available. I made the huge mistake of paying for 3 weeks accommodation here and was in dire need of a holiday afterwards. Alex K wrote a review Jul 2015\n",
      "10 Rubbish The rooms were dirty and had a seriously bad smell of cigarettes!    Shower didn't work!    Carpets had mould growing on them!  There is a new hotel/apartments being built directly opposite the hotels I expect construction noise thru out the day!    Check out after an hour and found alternative accommodation.

      "40 Very happy indeed My friends and I booked in to the Neta resort during the last few days of our Asia trip, we choose to stay here for 4 nights and we weren't disappointed. At the time of our visit in March 2015 they were in the middle of a revamp of the hotel but the work wasn't intrusive. The whole place is having a facelift and we were very impressed with what we saw for the money we paid. The facilities in the rooms we good, breakfast was reasonable for the price and the staff were very helpful. Only downside is that we didn't have a safe or a kettle in our room, we had to go downstairs and request a jug of hot water every time we wanted to make a coffee. Also the balcony door was broken so couldn't lock it which was a concern as we didn't have a safe. They have numerous safety deposit boxes behind reception though so it wasn't a real issue. All in all we were very happy with the hotel and I would certainly stay there again if I visited Pattaya. Deanread wrote a review Apr 2015\n",

Became dirty, rude staff, the driver of the Shuttle was never on the spot, monotonous Breakfast, in the cooler water,milk and juice are constantly on the bottom. But it's flowers - we was robbed. Opened the suitcase. 3 days stole the money in three rooms. The hotel is not responsible for the safes in the rooms too. Safes are now under lock and key, without a code. DO NOT KEEP MONEY IN THE ROOM SAFE. Better at the reception photograph the contents of your package of documents for the employee and give for safekeeping in a safe Deposit box at the reception.

      "30 Will not stay here next time. Lived here 10 days in December 2012.  80 % of guests were Russian.    Positive points:  Located in a quiet street.  Free internet (only in loby on the first floor)  No fees for the guests.    Negative points:  Breakfast was the same for all 10 days.  Comparatively far from Second Road. Yes it is 10-15 min by foot. But when it was 30 deg C, I wanted to get in to Tuk-Tuk or on a bike as soon as possible. Eventually I rent bike and was happy.  No ceiling lights. (! really ridiculous !)  Old furniture.  Ants in bathroom. (They were really small, so they were not very annoying. )  There was no shower curtain in the bathroom. So I went to \"Big C\" shop and bought it together with shower rod, which can be seen on the photo. (Cost me: Curtain 3 USD + Rod 4 USD + Moto Taxi 2 USD x 2 = 11 USD )    Overall impression was not very good. Pavel P wrote a review Dec 2012\n",
      "30 There’s better value closer to the beach The Balitaya Resort has a really nice lobby with a cool vibe and very friendly staff. Unfortunately, the rooms are just okay for Pattaya at the price they charge.    Having never been to Pattaya, a friend and I chose the Balitaya based on positive Agoda reviews and a nice price point. The double room we stayed in was very clean and nicely appointed, but smelled funky. The bathroom was a bit of a functional disaster, with an open concept shower that had a high drain that water flowed away from, pooling on the tile floor around the toilet instead. The toilet also jammed on our first night, but a staff member quickly fixed it.    The breakfast that was included in our room price was nice, with a mix of Thai and western favorites. The restaurant was bright and fresh, and opened up to the hotel pool. The pool seemed to sit empty for the duration of our stay, with the location and vibe not matching the intended use. A hotel taxi was available for free to take you to shopping centers, which was a nice touch.    After experiencing a few more hotels in Pattaya that were closer to the beach and better appointed for the same price, we would probably not bother staying at the Balitaya Resort again. There’s simply better value elsewhere. Ty K wrote a review Nov 2012\n",

      "40 Value for your money Looking for a value, this place offers it. If you looking for a 5 star hotel, you will not be happy here. So let's look at what they offer. First they offer a clean spacious room with air conditioning and a hot water shower. They also offer free taxi transportation in the Pattaya area. In the morning a free breakfast. They actually will cook to order at no charge. Help your self to all you can drink coffee and juice.    An site they have motorbike rentals without hassles. This is a real nice benefit for those who can drive a bike, especially in Thailand. They charged me on 140 baht for the day. This is about 5 US dollars.    Okay, your looking for a clean hotel with a reasonable price and some extras, this is the place. Honestly it does look a little worn, but still a great value. MrToddR wrote a review Sep 2011\n",
      "10 AVOID !!!!!!! Booked the Hotel for a 2 night stop over in pattaya with my girlfriend. Photos look good on website but hotel is pretty worn out.  I ended up only staying one night and getting a refund for the 2nd night and going elsewhere.  Rooms are spacious but my room was infested with ants, they were literally everywhere. When i complained with reception they just didnt seem too worried or overly shocked about it but did offer me another room.  I moved rooms and stayed the night, only to find the next morning that the 2nd room had ants too, not as bad as the first but still more than enough for me not want to stay there a second longer.  Complained to agoda and got a refund for the 2nd night.  Rooms also do not have hairdryers, and there are no irons or ironing boards available either.  Only good thing about this hotel is location, very close to centre.  Please AVOID this hotel. VintageTQ wrote a review Jun 2011\n",
      "30 large room, but no bath or internet in the room The room is nice, quite large and comfortable, except that it doesn't have a bath - only a shower with no curtain, so the floor gets wet easily.    Wifi is free but only available in the lobby (no signal in the room). There are two PC's available in the lobby in case you don't have your own laptop.    The hotel is located at a 4 minutes walking distance from a main street. There is a free taxi service from the hotel to the nearby area, however this service is not offered on your way coming back to the hotel.    The walk-in room rate (including breakfast) was higher (1600 BHAT) compared to booking online via booking.com or agoda.com (around 1400 BHAT), so if you happen to walk-in - you are advised to check online rate before committing to walk-in rates. elodTlv wrote a review Nov 2010\n",
      "10 Construction right next door=no sleep and they do not care Nice modern place with good size room but no real view of anything. Decent price ($45/night. during the low season). What's the problem? They just started construction of a new hotel right next door but no one on staff disclosed that when I checked in on a Friday afternoon that EXTREMELY loud construction starts on Saturday AND SUNDAY mornings(!) at 8 am. Yes, Sunday morning. Unbelievable. As you may know, Pattaya is known for it's nightlife and staying out late. So forget about sleeping in. There was no manager on duty on Sunday during my check out, so I paid the second night with my credit card (curiously I had to pay the first night in Baht up front on arrival-  now I know why) and e-mailed the management company in charge in Bangkok and, per standard, got the run around of a request of a very reasonable one night refund only of about $40. Yes, I understand this is not the US or the West and customer service standards are much different and circumspect. But they do not seem to understand the consequences of real and honest feedback from their customers in a forum like this and others. Their proposed solution is that I \"come back and stay with them again\". Yeah right, I live half way around the world.    Again, this construction seemed to be just underway and it appears that it will continue for many months to come. Beware. Wolverine154 wrote a review Sep 2008\n",

      "40 Great location, large rooms, quite ok for the rate. I just spent 8 days here with a room on the 3rd floor (of 6 - Ground floor = 1).    At the walk-up rate of 1200 baht per night (including a decent breakfast, and free PC & internet access in the lobby). The hotel has a nice pool and chill out area, and the breakfast/dining area overlooks it.    The room has all the basics you'd expect including a/c, shower & toilet (no bath), in-room tea and coffee, large comfortable bed, coffee table & chairs, balcony. It also has cable TV with a number of international channels (mostly news and a couple of movie channels), although the TV reception was poor. Mini Bar stocked with affordable beers, soft-drinks, chocolates and chips.    Prices for room service (which finishes at about 9pm) and laundry is very affordable, and not over-priced. The Hotel has it's own Songtaew which provides lifts into the central shopping areas. However it's only a short stroll to most places. 2 or 300 metres down the soi and you arrive at \"The Avenue\" shopping plaza which has some great restaurants, Movie Theatre, Bowling ally etc. I especially recommend a meal there at \"Orange by the Sea\" who offer exceptional service and a Multiple Menu which includes French, Lebanese, Indian, Japanese and of course Thai dishes. It's a little expensive by Thai standards, but the meals were quality. Also DO try the \"Banzai Banana\" fruit smoothie there.    I found the hotel to be a little noisy late at night, due to inconsiderate guests coming home late without any concern for others peace and quiet. The hotel seemed to rather popular with Eastern European guests.    A word of warning, that construction of a large apartment building has begun on the rear side of the hotel, and guests in the rooms over-looking it, over the next 12 months or so, will be affected by construction noise.    Over-all I found the hotel to be a good honest establishment, and one of the very few that DO NOT extort their guests into an over-priced COMPULSORY Christmas or New Years Eve dinner.

      "40 A happy oasi In the middle of the central chaos of Pattaya there is this small, delicious hotel surrounded by an amazing garden, with a creek just in front each room at the ground floor, no noise, huge rooms with every comfort, helpful staff. After a day out, it seems to come back in your private paradise. Roberta Mariucci wrote a review Dec 2019\n",
      "10 Once it was a good and quiet place Groups of Asian Tourists make incredible noise, Cleaning Lady is stealing coins when they are lying in the room, Management completely helpless and not open to critics and i guess the Fotos of the \"Room with City View\" say enough. Never again hallowach_1 wrote a review Feb 2019\n",
      "50 My second stay here This time i was very lucky to get there junior suit at a really low price the room was by far the biggest iv stayed in , im not sure how many there are like this in the hotel.    This hotel is at the end of a small soi , but close to a big shopping ,food cinema complex, and with bars to the left and right , but its far enough back from the main road, and is settled in a little oasis of trees and water features making a lovely chilled place to relax .    Both the day time and evening reception, and general staff were excellent, always ready to help with anything.    The cleaning staff prompt and did a great job.    Yes it misses a pool, but thats the only downside i love this place and will continue to use ketamine wrote a review Nov 2018\n",
      "50 Quiet place inside inside the center of Pattaya It was my first trip in Pattaya and I was looking for quiet place to relax and rest after parties. Me and my wife found this place charming. Staff was very helpful(thank you!) and rooms were clean. Suitable for families and couples. Max Baldin wrote a review Aug 2017\n",
      "50 Great hotel for a stay in pattaya The hotel is a really nice and sweet hotel in pattaya. It is really close to the Main Street but really really quiet. The rooms are amazingly clean, and the hotel staff is really flexible, I would recommend this hotel and I would come again.  Thank you very very much for the nice stay and a great thank you to the sweet staff. Leah K wrote a review Jun 2017\n",
      "30 Cheap clean Stayed here 25th December till 9th January it is in a nice location quite but central to every were it is very basic but very clean ,shower not the most powerfull but warm ,was dissapointed we had no fridge or any were we could sit out side on balcony . But you get what you pay for bed was so comfortable along with pillows .but was pleasant place and great place just to get your head down at night BillyDawson127 wrote a review Jan 2017\n",
      "30 Very Basic Stayed here in the middle of April with a friend.    Didn't like the noise at night as the hotel is near markets and bars.    Room is not as advertised: only three working plugs, nowhere to dry clothes, no bathrobes and single glazed windows (noise and vibration are extreme from the outside).    However, all staff were attentive, friendly and helpful at reception.    Overall, nice hotel for party lovers but for a short time. Delementality O wrote a review Apr 2016\n",
      "40 Almost perfect Located in the heart of Pattaya, right in front of the biggest shopping-center (Centre Festival) of the city and surrounded by pulsing nightlife. The beach is ten minutes walk. At the same time the hotel is fairly quite because it is located in a small street without go go bars.  My room was cozy and clean. The housekeeping service is provided late in the morning to allow customers to have enough sleep after partying all night.  The rates are reasonable and the staff friendly.  I was only a bit disappointed by the lack of credit-card readers to pay for the accommodation and wifi not working in my room (have to come close to the reception to get the signal).  I would come back again. NicolaOrl wrote a review Dec 2015\n"

      "50 Second stay Stayed in P32 again for 17 days over xmas and new year. Was not let down good room clean tidy and food was very good…English breakfast a must.  Nice friendly place with lots of people to meet who use the bar for daily chit chat.  All the sports you require if you’re into that with staff very friendly.  Once again excellent stay in Pattaya thank you. Gary L wrote a review Jan 2017\n",
      "30 Good Food Meals were good. The Magners cold and the Guinness properly poured and chilled. The one negative to the stop was the very poor Filipino singers, very off key and limited to what they can sing. A nice place to chill before the music starts. JESSVANPELT wrote a review Nov 2016\n",
      "50 Pleasant stay Stayed here for two weeks from the start of March with a friend. We walked in off the street and booked for room and breakfast.    Staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms were nice and clean. Also had a good strong shower. Live band most nights too.    Had almost every football game on with a few tv's so usually had a couple different games on at once. 24 hour bar as well which was good for a nightcap after being out all night.    Honestly couldn't fault the place and I'll definitely be back. Jb9009 wrote a review Mar 2016\n",
      "10 Terribly run place Arrived on New years eve with two rooms booked through agoda. Made the booking more than three weeks prior as Pattaya gets very busy over New years. When we arrived we were asked to sit down and wait. After ten minutes, the rude manager told us that we would have to stay at a different place in Pattaya Soi 6! We later discovered that these rooms were above a ladyboy gogo bar. We refused and asked for the two standard rooms that we had already booked and paid for at the location we were at. it became obvious that the greedy management had given our rooms away to other customers and the only room that was left was a family room that me and my friend had to share. The manager never apologised and the owner, a loud old dragon of a lady, offered us a partial refund. We accepted. The room was reasonably comfortable despite the air con being very weak. Despite this, we would have much preferred the two rooms that we had booked. It is impossible to sleep in the rooms as there is a live band that plays in the bar below until 2am. Upon check out, the manager refused to give us the refund that he had previously mentioned. The owner doesn't have a clue about customer service and should stick to running ladyboy bars. DO NOT STAY HERE! DrSmithBangkok wrote a review Jan 2016\n",
      "10 Bar becomes guest house I have to say now that this is a brand new guest house converted from a bar so the issues I had may be remedied in the future. I arrived to be told they had booked me in to accommodation in soi 6 (Beach Road). I was not impressed as I did not want to stay in soi 6 (as anyone who has been there will understand).I also recognised the hotel. It was formerly known as Pook ladyboy bar and is just up from LK Metro. The 'rooms' she wanted to stick us in, in soi 6 were above the 'other' Pook ladyboy bar- NO CHANCE! We refused to leave and showed them our Agoda booking made way before Christmas. The owner and the manager still had not apologised for giving our rooms away. After a lot of back and forth and threats to call Agoda we were offered a shared room! This is obviously not what we wanted, unfortunately it was this or soi 6 as Pattaya was fully booked. We made it clear we were not happy but took the room offered, they told us IF someone checks out on New Years day we can have their rooms and we can also have 1000THB refund. We then left whilst they cleaned the room which took forever. Upon return we were told we will only give you 400THB. The next day when hungover they offered us rooms at about 2pm as we were getting ready to go out. We declined as we had less than 24 hours left. As I was walking down the stairs I was accosted by the (loud and very rude) manager who decided to tell me in front of a lot of customers eating, that I wasn't getting any money at all because I didn't move! My reply was simply 'whatever' as I was sick of her borderline aggressive attitude by now. The hotel itself is very new and clean and the beds are really comfortable. The aircon was terrible and took about 4 hours to cool the room even a little bit. It was also very noisy and I couldnt really sleep. The shower was broken, showed a green light but didnt actually work, cold water only! I can't comment on the food or free breakfast as I refused to eat here. WIFI was never mentioned, so I can't comment on this either. I honestly think if the owner and manager start acting like hoteliers instead of bar managers then this place could improve and warrant its 2 star claim. However I will not be returning and I cannot recommend it to others, sorry! scouse_tommy_11 wrote a review Jan 2016\n"

Breakfast you can easy get outside the hotel and also many restaurants and bar are around. ThomD wrote a review Dec 2019\n",
      "10 Worst hotel They are not giving as what they are showing in online booking websites I made a mistake by booking this hotel online and had very very bad experience with this hotel no Water in the bathroom dirty rooms I will give them a 0 number and this hotel should be closed RehanSaghir wrote a review Oct 2017\n",
      "20 Only Location - No STAR Hosiptality We had been to Thailand for our Anniversary celebrations and visited Pattaya. This Hotel has a good location and just a walk away from beach but property is old and rooms are not modern enough to appeal.    We were given a room which was not clean and no view and after having a tough discussions via Tour Agency ; we could get a room on higher floor with a side view of sea.  Don't think that you will have SEA View from this Hotel though this near beach. Lifts offer a sea view. :-)    Pool Area is good and offers you a good view.    Room Quality is average and feel like cheated with high cost. Staff is also not polite.    All in all ; this is not a great hotel but location is good and if you want to stay near beach and roam around in evening; this is a good palce. AbhishekDeshpande wrote a review Feb 2017\n",
      "50 Value for money Best Indian food in the city.  Decent guest friendly rooms as well.  Great behaviour and superb location, right in the middle of beach road full to sea view and street shops are just across the road.  Not so cheep not so costly.

      "50 Nice location in Pattaya It is very nice location in Pattaya. Just down there is bar and just walk crus the road there is beach and great balcony restaurant sea view rooms.

      "40 Coffee stop I didn't actually stay here, just shot in for a coffee and snack while waiting for a bus back to Bangkok. Their sitting area is comfortable and I like the decoration. Staff is friendly and has a good drink selection from iced coffee to beer. Nice place to chill out for a couple hours. Alberto Gutierrez wrote a review Jul 2017\n",
      "40 An Enjoyable Stay In a super convenient location, SleepCafe is a super short walk around the corner from the Pattaya bus station, which is how we stumbled across it.    At 360 Baht per night (which includes bedding, towel, shower, and continental breakfast), we stayed in a clean dorm-style room. The floors were separated by gender, which offered some level of comfort/safety, but you can also ask to have your coed group stay together if you'd like too.    The decor was trendy and clean. The cafe had a variety of coffee, smoothie, and snack options. Free wifi is available to customers and overnight guests.    A really incredible feature is that this hostel offers a nap room for 50 Baht/4 hours. You can come in an nap in the air conditioning while you wait to catch your bus at the station around the corner!    Overall, a decent price for an enjoyable stay.    TIP: If you book in advanced online the room is 350 Baht per person. They will not except this pricing for walk-ins. Victoria B wrote a review Mar 2016\n"

      "30 Nice oub Went to Retox for a pool comp.  Nice Pub atmosphere is great  Music was good a bit loud at times but what the heck it’s a pub  Easy pArking or easy walking distance to most places a good night out  I would recommend a visit Glenn002 wrote a review Feb 2019\n",
      "50 Back I enjoyed my breakfast there last September I went back again and was not disappointed they’re as good as the first time I went and they have now extended the place which is great as it gets very busy for breakfast davohereford wrote a review Jan 2018\n",
      "40 Central and value place to stay I'm wondering why people review the breakfast as this is the page for the hotel, not the restaurant... Anyhow  I stayed for 3 nights (in room 9) and the price per night is 600 Baht. The room has a comfortable double bed, aircon, a large fridge, a huge flat TV, hot water, free wifi and a little balcony. Also daily room cleaning and 2 complimentary bottles of water. Two little downpoints: Even I stayed on the top floor, sometimes it was loud from the bar, as later at night as louder. And I was missing a desk with chair or something like this, difficult to work on a laptop without. Apart from this, great stay! oggse wrote a review Mar 2017\n",
      "10 Terrible service Great breakfast at a great price but I suppose you get what you pay for. Staff indifferent and impossible to get any service. I would sooner pay a bit more and have decent staff and good service.That said if you can put up with the appalling service it's probably the best value breakfast in Pattaya Merseyboy2 wrote a review Dec 2016\n",
      "40 Brilliant Breakfast A terrific sports bar with lots of big screens. A buzzing atmosphere especially on football match day or the test match cricket. The food is good and there is a wide selection of beers. The outstanding feature is its proper English breakfast for under 100bahts - well appreciated by the many westerners who frequent the bar/restaurant/hotel.  Like the new Retox the only negative is the lack of good female toilet facilities(my western partner insisted on me stating this) davidwilliambarnes wrote a review Nov 2016\n",
      "50 Great sports bar and restaurant Huge sports bar. Fantastic menu and good hotel. Must be 50 plus TVs showing sports from all over. We had our own private booth. Air con and really friendly staff. Steaks really tasty and breakfast was what I needed after a long night in the coolest sports bar in town. emily b wrote a review Oct 2016\n"

      "10 Absolute scam - dodgy Russian owned My wife and I wanted to spend the long weekend away with our British bulldog. We booked the hotel via Booking.com.    I was a little surprised when they said it was 4-stars, when it was obviously a privately owned house with rooms divided in fairly attractive quarters. Obviously not 4 stars and Booking.com failed to catch this.    Couple days before our arrival date a Ladyboy called to say that they were over booked, but will try and find another place.    We declined the offer and requested the hotel to clear the situation with Booking.com    Upon the end of the apparent weekend we received a email from Booking.com stating that we were a no show and will be charged a fee!    My wife called to clarify with Booking.com who stated they will investigate. Fairly shortly after that we received a call, but one on the other side. Upon calling back no one answered.    After calling Booking.com again the call centre stated that there have been reports of this kind, even a giggle from the person on the call, but yet they failed to remove this hotel from the list.    Poor service from Booking.com. Roamingbeast wrote a review Feb 2016\n"

Hotel location is very conveniet and east to go back to pattaya beach area.Rooms are large and confortable as payment level and its rate. Bathrooms are clean and normal standards. Regularly per day rooms beds, sheets are changing, cleaning everyday. The biggest shopping Mall (BIG C) just 150meter walking distance away. excellent staff. Highly Recommended to stay.

A clean and safe place to be at an extremely reasonable rate in the heart of Pattaya. I would definitely be back there again! Condosearch S wrote a review Feb 2016\n",
      "50 Very cheap accommodation out of sleeze area MPlace is very cheap, and you pay for electricity and water you use. A bike cab costs 40 Baht to go to the main bar areas near the beach area. There are half a dozen bars around MPlace plus a 711 50 metres away. The main thing is rooms are clean, serviced every three days, have aircon, fan, fridge, microwave in room and is away from the noise of downtown. Weekly charge is around nightly charge of main hotels, small apartment block of around 12 units or so. Lots of eateries around that cost about 100-150 Baht for a meal, close to the Big C department store/shopping Centre to buy stuff. Not a place for wild partiers or those who want extra services in 5 star hotels, but one for those who want a friendly safe place to stay. I stayed 10 days and am going back next year.

      "40 Pattaya My review is based on 2 nights stay in September 2015.    What I like?  - Big hard bed , which suits me  - Big room (A size room) , well equipped with kettle, safe , big fridge, microwave,working table  - Clean - very clean (I don't normally expect much with hotel like this, but I am really pleased that the blankets smell fresh and clean :)) )  - Near to a lot of local food hawker stores. And a big market (Big C) is just 8 minutes walk away .  - The hotel provides simple breakfast , toast with jam and coffee/tea.  - The owner is fluent with english, but the staff doesn't seems to speak much english. They are generally helpful and attentive.  - Wifi is free and good. The wifi slowed down a bit on one of the days, and the owner went to check immediately after I have informed him.    What I didn't like?  - Noise. There is a school next to M Place. Unfortunately, there was event on one of the morning that I was there and the noise was a bit unbearable.    Is not my first trip to Pattaya,but my first time staying in hostel like hotel. For the price that I am paying, is reasonable. What I like the most is clean, feels safe and decent. Although is in \"central pattaya\" - I am feeling a bit out of city - surrounded by school, local shops, etc. I recommend it to those who wish to stay longer in Pattaya just to experience Pattaya life and or like to be a bit further away from the crowd. jollygal wrote a review Sep 2015\n"

      "50 Cosy restaurant We have never stayed at this hotel but we have been to their restaurant multiple times. It’s quiet even peaceful on a street that is very busy and noisy. It’s like a little oasis in the middle of the city. The waitresses are very attentive and make you feel like you are family. The food has always been tasty and fresh and we have never been disappointed. They make a great meatloaf which I have had many times. Happy-seniors2 wrote a review Mar 2019\n",

      "50 Excellent value for money This was mine and hubby's first time in Pattaya and to BJ Lodge. The friends we were travelling with have stayed here many times before and I can see why. We were greeted warmly by the manager who assisted checking us in and taking our bags to our room.  Rooms are spacious, we had a balcony overlooking the pool. Air con and a good sized fridge, large bed, Satellite tv.  The pool is a decent size located on the 2nd floor.  We had breakfast here everyday. We ordered BLTs & chips for lunch at the pool which the staff delivered.  The hotel is at a good location for shops and bars but far enough away from Walking Street which is where all the clubs are.  The beach is 3 mins away.  If you're going to Pattaya for the first time I highly recommend you choose BJ Lodge as your base, you won't be disappointed. If you take the time to read other reviews you'll notice a recurring theme...people keep coming back..says it all to be fair! mrsrisla wrote a review Jun 2017\n",

      "40 very very convenience and friendly staff If you landed in Suvarnabhumi airport, just headed a level down to the bus station and to Pattaya bus counter to buy a ticket. Don't have to wait long for the bus coz very hour there will be a bus but sometimes have to wait a bit longer usually at late evening. the ticket cost about Thai Bhat 120.It takes about 2 hours to reach Pattaya depending on the road jammed.  Once reach Pattaya you can either take a toot toot or personal taxi to the hotel that cost THB200. just a 20minutes drive to the hotel.  The room and the bath room were spacious. the air cond works very good and the water heater is great. there was a small balcony and i used to wash my clothes and hang it when the songran festival coz you will be wet once you're step outside the hotel. he...he.... The house keeping were friendly and so do the front desk.  The hotel restaurant's food were pretty good and the price were quite reasonable. A bit upset with the wifi that doesn;t works very well in the room unless you stay in the room that is quite near the wifi access point at 5th floor . For those who loves to swim just book the level 2nd floor coz the swimming pool is located at level 2.  the hotel location is very very convenience.For the party animals It was just 30 to 40 minutes walk to the Walking Street with a lot of shops to shop around and just 5 minutes walk to the beach. If you are lazy to walk then just rent a motorcycles that will just cost about THB 150 perday. The road there were pretty busy and be sure to get your international licence coz you don't want to fine by the policeman.  Over all this hotel was in a great location, only the hotel is a bit too old but even old hotel every thing is clean and without any smell at all. Hopefully the owner will upgrade the rooms and the wifi access to all the rooms. Joeycutie wrote a review Jun 2016\n",

It has a good restaurant with room service. It is a lady friendly hotel with good sized rooms and bathroom and an outdoor pool to cool off. I would certainly recommend this hotel.

Rooms are all air-conditioned, with private facilities, large refrigerators, satellite TV and small balconies. The restaurant is very nice and is open from breakfast until midnight. I have stayed at this hotel every year for many years and it has a clientelle of regular customers who return again and again. While other hotels can be nearly empty, this nice 50-room hotel has a high occupancy rate so book early, especially in high season. I love it! Kevin H wrote a review Feb 2016\n",

The staff is extremely friendly and greeted us each morning. What stands out also, are the cool historical photos in the lobby. It's really interesting seeing old Pattaya, before it got built out and how the previous generations got to enjoy the town. I would definitely recommend this hotel and I'm looking forward to returning one day. enc429 wrote a review Sep 2015\n",

      "40 Great small hotel. The BJ Holiday Lodge is located about one block from the beach. The rooms are being remodeled as I am writing this, so there is some noise during the daytime. But, the rooms with have new air conditioning and flat screen TVs. Each room has a small balcony just big enough for two people.  The restaurant is very good. I have been getting my fix of Thai food. The chef is great with everything on the menu. It is a pretty cheap place to have a very good meal.    I would certainly say that this is not the most expensive hotel in Pattaya. But for an affordable, clean and friendly hotel, The BJ Holiday Lodge is a great pick for a holiday in Pattaya. Cody B wrote a review Sep 2014\n",

      "40 As Good AsEver , But !! Returned to the BJ`s Holiday Lodge as the last visit was so good and must say the hotel is as good as ever but with one major drawback ....................  There is MASSIVE building work going on all around the hotel and , while not the Lodges fault , must play a part in any decision you may make about a visit !  Work starts at around 6am and go`s on till late evening around 8pm , or later at times ! you have concrete mixer wagons on the road outside the front entrance , material wagons as well , drills going all day just to add to the noise ! must add the noise did not bother me as i just turned off my Hearing Aid till away from the hotel :)  As for the Hotel itself the excellent staff and sevice continue , room nice , clean and spacious with large fridge topped up with 2 free bottles of water every morning by the cleaning staff who continue to be cheerful and welcoming even remembering me from the last visit over 4 years ago !  The food in the restaurant was of the highest quality and always well cooked ! choice of Thai and European food available from 7am till 11pm , 7days a week ! the Ice Coffee is especially good here as was the range of drinks available at the bar or at your table !  So Overall a good choice for your stay in Pattaya just be aware of the Construction work around the hotel which , of course , is NOT the fault of the Holiday Lodge !

      "40 Good location, I felt at home here, friendly staff but noisy due to building site.. I spent five nights at this hotel in March 2013. The location is great, just across the beach road but only yards from Pattaya's narrow beach and also far enough away (but not too far) from all the noise etc of Walking Street and the surrounding area.    The rooms are spacious, clean but basic and most have balconies, the staff are pretty friendly and there is a bar/restaurant which serves an American or Thai breakfast (not included in the room price) and other Thai dishes all day long which are really cheap.    The owner is a former American soldier who was involved in the Vietnam war in the 60/70s who first came to Pattaya in those days where the soldiers had a break here. There are so many of them that came back to open bars/hotels etc after the war. In the lobby there are some interesting photos of Pattaya in the 60/70s where there is nothing there and photos taken in the same locations today where it is all built up.    The hotel also has a pool on the 2nd floor, I liked it here, the only down side is that it is right next to a building site where they start work at 8am every day of the week, It didn't really bother me because I woke up early despite being out late, but did I move rooms after three days to the other side of the hotel which was better.

On arrival, they took me to my room which was right next to a construction site. When I mentioned about the noise they promptly moved me to another room on the other side of the property. This room was huge! Ocean views and overlooking the pool. The staff were more than happy to move all my belongings for me. The restaurant downstairs has reasonable priced food - both western and thai. Staff are happy to deliver you food to your room. leanylou wrote a review Aug 2012\n",
      "40 Friendly ! I booked this room through a booking agent for the low price and location. I arrived one day early and they were able to accommodate me at a very good rate. The staff there was the warmest and friendliest that I've ever experienced in Pattaya. The swimming pool and restaurant were more than adequate. It's located less than 100 meters from the beach road. I would definitely stay there again. mtnhiguy wrote a review May 2012\n",
      "50 Pleasant surprise in Pattaya ...on my stay at BJ's. Upon arrival, I was greeted by friendly security guard (he even speaks some German). The super clean room has every amenity, A/C, fridge, lock box, closet with hangers, nice bathroom, TV, roomy balcony etc. Hotel is very clean, friendly and airy. Staff is exceptionally friendly. Room service is available on request. Wake up call was delivered timely. Pictures in the lobby tell story of Pattaya before the \"boom\". Nice touch. Thank you for the pool facing room. Much appreciated. Will stay here again. Only regret, why didn't I find this place sooner??? MuiThai wrote a review Apr 2012\n",

      "50 A good choice I have just spent 3 nights at BJ, not my first visit. The hotel is at the quieter end of Beach Road, and only 50 meters from the beach. There is something for everyone within a short walk, restaurants, bars, beach, and entertainment. The hotel serves good food, has great staff, and is good value for money (1200 baht). I think nearly all rooms have a balcony overlooking the pool. They are clean and comfortable, with multi-channel TV, air-con, in-room security box, en-suite, etc.. The hotel is suitable for couples, families, and solo travellers. Highly recommended....only one word of caution...there is construction work taking place on an adjoining site (not visible from the room or pool, and there is no dirt or dust). It can be a little noisy from 8am to 5pm, but it did not bother me at all. As an experienced traveller, I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel. PatORegan wrote a review Feb 2012\n",

      "40 Value for money For the price that you pay - about 1200 Thai Baht per night - this represents good value for money. The rooms are quite nice though the bathroom/showers are on the small side.    The staff are very friendly and the hotel is in an ideal location in that it's away from the noise but close enough to the night life and beach.    The restaurant can get quite busy and is also excellent value and one can meet the owner - a friendly Texan and Pattaya icon known as BJ - there most evenings. Bloodaxe31 wrote a review Jun 2011\n",

The rooms are clean and spacious and are made up everyday by the smiling maids. The food is good and caters for all. Never had any problems during my stays there and would recommend it to all.

      "50 Does what it says on the tin We booked this hotel on advice from friends who live in Pattaya , have stayed in many hotels in Pattaya because of our connections with the Fr.Ray Orphanage.  We found the BJ to be all that we needed , Nice rooms which were well serviced to a good standard by the cheerful and friendly maids , we used to leave a 100 baht tip on the pillow for them as they did such a good job !  Breakfast was ok with a good mix of dishes for all palates , restaurant was open up to 11 pm each day and the food was Good, plentiful and well cooked.  What makes BJ`s different from the rest ?  It`s BJ himself and his family and staff , in a word .... Excellent ,  Iff illness allows we will be back this year !  Do yourselves a favour and book into BJ`s !

The staff are the most friendlies people i have ever come across, whom can't do enough for you during your stay!!!! this applies to the Chamber Maids, Recepition staff, Resturant staff, the General whom greets every guest at all hours and remembers their names!!. This is all held together by BJ, his lovely wife and daughter it is a credit to them all as they are a wonderful team.  This year we brought two friends with us and they loved everthing about BJ'S and were very impressed with the hotel and staff.    I would like to thank all at BJ'S for making my holiday such wonderful experience.  We look forward to see you all again in the future. NellyChigwellEssex wrote a review Sep 2009\n",
      "50 fantastic hotel with wonderful owners and staff who make you feel part of their family Never have we stayed in such a warm homely atmosphere, where you genuiely felt that you were part of a family. BJ, his wife and lovely children were nothing but kind, genuine and hospitable in every way, even down to letting my husband watch his favourite team on T.V in the bar at 01.45am. Their staff are a credit to them and we will have no hesitation in recommending to all our friends that BJ Holiday Lodge is where to stay whilst visiting Pattaya. The food is second to non and very good value for money,with a varied menu of Thai and European dishes. The rooms are very clean and serviced everyday, with fresh towels, bedding,water etc. It is located only a few yards from the beach, but has its own pool too if you don't want to swim in the sea. This hotel is only a 10 baht ride to walking street and the shopping malls, and only a two minute walk to the second road were all the bars are. And yet it is a peaceful haven at the end of the night away from all the hustle bustle. We find it hard to find fault of this hotel other than it is situated on a one way road for getting a baht bus back from the barsof a night when you are slightly intoxicated. This is truly a value for money little gem and we hope to return ourselves again in Dec 2010. shep9 wrote a review Apr 2009\n",
      "50 great american breakfast stayed here from christmas day until jan 6th and i can tell you this is one well run hotel. i choose it initially based off other travellers positive reviews and its location nestled in soi 3. clean well equipped rooms (big fridge!) friendly proffesional staff, just a really good experience that springboards your holiday. i will definately be staying here when i come to pattaya again in june. food in this place is knockout as well. davep1969 wrote a review Feb 2009\n",
      "50 Great value and friendly staff Nicely located at the north end of Pattaya, very close to the beach and some quality restaurants nearby within easy walking distance. Found our room very clean, the staff always greeted us with a smile and very helpful and respectful. NO cockroaches, ants, etc. Construction at the hotel next door has been completed so no noise distraction or dust problem. Nice balcony to relax on. Very nice swimming pool. Didn't notice a breakfast buffet but the 60 baht breakfast was a good deal. Some great shopping venues only a short baht bus trip from this hotel. If driving, parking available under the hotel. Rooms very economically priced from 1000 baht. We stayed in the larger 1200 baht room. Hotel also has two-bedroom family rooms available for 2400 baht. Will be staying at this hotel again. polehawk wrote a review Jan 2009\n",
      "20 B.J. Holiday Lodge,Pattaya We stayed at the hotel for a short period in early january 2008.The hotel is as clean as can be, staff are friendly and meals in the restaurant are reasonable, including the American Breakfast at 55 thai baht. The downside is that a new 7 storey hotel is being built in the adjacent lot, consequently the swimming pool is full of dust and gets sunshine for only about 10 mins per day, around noon. One also has to keep the doors shut, to help block out the noise from the building site, and naturally, the dust from same. DO NOT go there if you are asthmatic. Work starts on the building site around 7am daily, including sundays, and finishes anytime from 6pm onwards, depending on what the builders have to do on the day in question. Soi 3 is situated well in north pattaya, midway between beach road and second road, and is about 10 mins walk from all attractions, including the famous Alcazar showclub (k.thoeys - ladyboys ). Ideal for single males looking for fun, as pattaya is renowned for this - not good for families ,since too many girlie bars, massage parlours and brothels nearby. Truefacts wrote a review Jan 2008\n"

Hotel rooms need a total revamp one wardrobe and a dressing table with no drawers to put things is not acceptable storage, could also do with more power points,and modern showers put in. basically the rooms need completely modernising. The hotel itself is in a great position close to bars etc but being on a side street is quiet at nite and the staff are friendly. Swimming pool is a bonus which is kept very clean and i had it almost to myself most days.All in all this could be a far better hotel if the owners upgraded the rooms to modern standards.

Thats about £6.00 per night increase, it now cost Baht 1090 per night or about £23 it's well over priced. Pattaya has changed a lot in the last few years, now it's so big, there is a lot of crime often drug realated, the roads are dangerous, the streets are dirty and it's becoming an expensive destination to have a holiday.

The rooms were clean and a very good size. The rooms all had massive beds, a good selection of drinks in the mini bar and a large bathroom / wet room. We agreed on a fee for the room of 675 baht a night for 14 nights. The room was cleaned daily, the cleaners never rushed you out of the room, whatever time you chose to leave they would clean it then.    There is parking facilities at the hotel if you chose to hire a bike or car, the pool area is awersome, a real sun trap during the day. You are less than 10 mins from the beach, a market round the corner which sells pretty much everything. For sure this is not a 5 star hotel but you are made to feel welcome and for the money it is awesome value for money. BoroTiddles wrote a review Jan 2009\n",
      "40 wouldnt dare tell anyone. i have stayed in this hotel many times due to the cheapness and the quality i was looking for was great years ago,of recent when ive stayed their the staff have been very kind to me especially mr chock wow his love for middlesbrough football club has grown more over the years and has now started to wear most of his attire i have brought for him chiefly his neck tie.as for the miserable one with glasses i think she is very pretty and has a good personality once you get to know her.i have never had problems with the cleen loom/how cleeping staff and have never had anything stolen,overall i would say if you want budget prices you have everything here its great,the pool area is nice and its always good to have a beer in the spa when you want to relax,i just hope others enjoy the experience i had and a quick return of mr chock wow would be a major boost for all at hotel skaw beach. simon-number-one wrote a review Jan 2009\n"

      "10 Hotel ok, but staff are awful I stayed at this hotel for three weeks. The room was clean and comfortable and the reception staff were pleasant to your face, however we had serious problems with staff entering our room when we left in the evenings. We had numerous items and money stolen and three members of staff were found to be responsible and were fired - we were not refunded any losses though and it was a significant amount of money and items. The hotel cleaner, who was a friend of these staff members gave us a hard time throughout our stay after the event, despite our complaints to the manager. She constantly accused us of drinking drinks from the minibar when we had not, and we were then billed for them and we also had a bill for missing towels [six in total] when we never took the hotel towels out of the room - not even to the pool because we had our own towels with us for that.    The pool was great, as long as you stayed to the deep end. The grouting was so badly in need of replacing that it had worn to the extent that the tile edges were exposed. Walking on the shallow end caused numerous cuts to our feet - not serious, but enough to cause bleeding. J L wrote a review Sep 2008\n",
      "40 simple but good i stayed skaw beach for 23 nights. this hotel has everything you need a big clean spacious room, clean bathroom and a huge bed. only downside is one of the receptionist a woman in her forties is extremely miserable.  room price for december is 790baht for room on the front with a balcony.  soi skaw beach has many little bars, all with rooms for rent prices range from 450-600baht a night. i recommend trying lays lounge or crazy eddies changnoi66 wrote a review Jan 2008\n"

      "50 Enjoy Outstanding location, wiht a private beach.  In my opinion Standard rooms need a bit interior upgrades.  Breakfast is average but this is in Thailand normal standard.  However we very enjoy the stay.  I will recommending to my friends. Martin wrote a review Dec 2021\n",
      "50 Great stay for family with kids This is the perfect place to stay for family with kids. At the beginning I was a bit hesitant because Pattaya is not the most kid friendly place in the world but after following advices from other moms I decided to go here: I loved it! The resort is next to amenities but has a very nature like feeling where children can enjoy the green and the nature. There are rabbits, a trampoline, a kid pool with slides another child friendly pool and a nice private beach. The food is also amazing. The rooms are big and comfortable. The staff super fri ndly. There is no doubt this is a perfect stay place! Elena wrote a review Oct 2020\n",
      "30 Meh We are locals, who had a wedding reception dinner for a couple dozen, and spent one night in an upstairs room.    As much as this place is touted with lots of glowing reviews as a magical eclectic lux beachfront getaway in the tropics, we beg to differ.    The good news ---    The food is good, lots of it. Eventually.    The taxi service when leaving is top notch, reasonably priced. However, there is no pick up shuttle available. You are on your own getting there.    The location at the base of Pratumnak hill on the beach yet close to everything, is nice.    The trampoline is fun, except when there is a tourist smoking just upwind from it.    The other news ---    Room:    Second hand smoke from the smoking area permeates the area around the villas. We could not enjoy our veranda, as most of the time it was stunk out by nicotine addicts gathering around the designated smoking area. So much for a non smoking room with Oceanfront fresh air.    The sheets reeked of residual laundry soap and/or dryer sheets even though we had specifically requested no scents; and were rough low thread count cheap, generic sheets. The room towels also reeked, whereas the pool towels did not have any residual smells.    The various roof top Air Conditioner heat exchangers from other units ran randomly all night, making it hard to sleep with all the hum, that even earplugs could adequately block out. So much for a quiet Oceanfront getaway.    Otherwise, a decent, slightly above average studio apartment sized room. Not 5 star at all.    Restaurant:    Appetizers appeared almost an hour after the reservation time, with the group seated and hungrily waiting, and only after multiple reminders to the staff, while we observed many other tables served. Once the main courses began to be served, the food was copious and good. But, what a wait.    The Sunday buffet brunch was quite good, with no waiting for service, of course.    The overall vibe is off, something reminds us of a cult like vibe. Either that, or a tyrannical style of management, that leaves the staff oozing anxiety, as they seemed undertrained, and over stressed. It is NOT the relaxed 5 star, effortless experience, even though the room rates are in that territory. With few exceptions, the staff treats the customers as adversaries, not valued customers. Maybe it's from dealing with too many annoying drunk Russian tourists, maybe it a top down management issue. Checkout was annoying, with the staff requesting we wait half an hour for them to sort out issues that should have been non issues.    We will return for Sunday brunch, but that's it. m0rphic wrote a review Feb 2020\n",
      "10 INAPPROPRIATE MASSAGE! DONT GET A MASSAGE! I was enjoying the resort very much until I made the unfortunate decision to get a massage they offered. It was overpriced (500 baht for 1 hour). I requested a Thai massage which is traditionally deep pressure and what I got was oil rubbed on my body. To make it 1000x worse, half way through the massage the masseuse touched my private area and tried to jack me off! Highly inappropriate! It wasn’t only until I told her no and nearly yelled at her, she stopped. When I brought it up to the receptionists, they were not phased. My stepmother is Thai and I brought her with to explain the situation so it was clear and they didn’t even care. From their expressions, it is probably normal. Not only was it a terrible massage for way too much, it was inappropriate. LADIES, DO NOT BRING YOUR HUSBANDS HERE!!!! rsimpson00 wrote a review Jan 2020\n",

      "40 Short holiday with young family Went to this resort almost 10 years ago with our 2 young girls which now teenagers, we came to this place many times. Our children love it because this resort is not only offering fun activities for kiddies with their free small animals roam around the resort, they also have dedicated children pool as well as organic gardening activity. They also have nice tree top bar for adults to enjoy the sunset drinks and meals. Can't swim on the beach that time due to many jelly fish swam around the area (one of our children got stung once there). This resorts very greenery and very relaxing... although at that time, they can do a bit better with the accommodation and the English TV channels, however might be change now. Still recommend this place for family with young children. RENES wrote a review Nov 2019\n",
      "40 Lots of positives We actually recommended our son with his 2 children to stay here - our eldest son lives a couple of miles away and it was ideal for them. They got a 2 bedroom villa which was perfect for them. The resort is quirky and has a jungle feel with the trees and stream full of fish. There were also rabbits and squirrels to keep the interest. The resort also grew its own vegetables such as lettuce and basil. There are 2 good pools and a section on the beach.  The food was very good as we ate at the restaurant, poolside and beach.  The reception staff were very helpful; the cleaner brilliant and the restaurant staff exceptional.  Here is the negative: a poolside member of staff persistently asked which room our son was in after getting clearance from the manager that we were free guests - a bit annoying. Also, the beach member of staff was particularly difficult for some reason!? Examples included: not giving us cutlery when we ordered lunch; not putting out cushions when there was one spot of rain; not supplying towels; packing the beds / umbrellas away at 4.30. Having stated the negatives our grandchildren and son had a great holiday. davidwilliambarnes wrote a review Sep 2019\n",
      "50 Simple and no frill We stayed at this resort for one night only. Our room was huge and spacious. It was a bit old but sparkling clean.    The pool was huge and you can access to the beach easily.    It is a simple no frill hotel. Great value for money. Phi Somchai wrote a review Jul 2019\n"

      "50 Family perspective of Birds, Bees, Cabbages and Condoms Other reviews of B&B/C&C before my family’s visit ring true: paradise in the jungle found through winding paths that the kids love to explore, overlooking a beautiful stretch of sandy beach perfect for wading out as far as you like while looking up at forested peaks on the other side of the Gulf of Thailand. The rooms (at least in villa 5) were lavish. I was a little concerned about one review that reported that the main pool and private beach access close at 7p - true. But 7p is after sunset when we visited, closing the private beach access at 7p was not strictly enforced, and there is public access at all hours right next door to B&B/C&C, so the closures at 7 was not an issue for us. The shallow kids’ pool, with 3 different slides that the kids loved, closed at 5p, so you need to plan ahead for that so the kids are not disappointed by an aborted evening slide plan.    The breakfast, included with our room, was an amazing buffet with eggs made to order, excellent coffee, a few thai options, but mostly western fare, just what the fam needed. For dinner, there was a good array of thai and western options, at resort prices (a large bottle of Chang was 200B after accounting for service charge and VAT). Dad liked the 60B cans of Heneiken in the room’s fridge.    The kids will ask what condoms are. Not just because of the obvious sign that says condoms, but because there are condoms everywhere in the restaurant: different colored ones under the 1/4’’ glass table tops arranged into flowers and hearts alongside birth control pills; and a large poster of stretched out flamboyant ones hanging from a clothes line with rooster combs and ticklers and bumpers.    Still, this place gets 5 stars. NZ-Phead wrote a review Jun 2019\n",
      "40 Tropical Rainforest Vacay! Ideal place to relax. Tropical forest feel. Even during peak summer, weather was pleasant within the resort due to the trees and foilage. Feels like living inside a jungle with the added advantage of the sea! Friendly and helpful staff. Aneesha H wrote a review Jun 2019\n",
      "40 Pleasant location, friendly staff and a nice getaway stayed at this hotel with family and booked a 'Tree Top Sky Nest' room. OK - getting to the room for the first time was a novelty and the view from the room to the beach was lovely. The trees in front of the room was also nice. Room was well arranged and clean. i had issues with having an open shower and bathroom. I wished there was a bit more privacy to it. Now comes the inconvenience aspects of this room - the room has two doors to enter with a stairs leading to the room - one has to close both doors and when there is service, you need to get down the stairs to open it. The next is the curtains behind the bed which is light and does wake you up early. Else, all good.  The resort restaurant has good food and it is a nice place. For kids it is a great place with a lot of green pockets around the resort and a kids swimming pool. I feel it is a wee bit expensive. The resort is old and would definitely need some improvements. Staff is friendly and helpful. Good place to head off to on a long weekend krazy_kolyn wrote a review May 2019\n",
      "50 Beautiful views from the terrace Stayed ten nights in the peak of Thailand's holiday season in their 'standard room'- decent size and more than adequate- at a cost of £460- a bit steep by Pattaya standards- but it right on a small semi private beach (it is shared with the AsiaHotel next door.)

      "40 100% recommend The rooms were a little basic but that is the only negative to this resort. The beds were comfortable and rooms clean. The pool area was beautiful with a view of the ocean. A little private stretch of beach was available if you wanted to go sit out there. We were more than happy on the sun beds by the pool. You could order drinks and food from there too. The breakfast was great - as a vegan it can always be a bit hit and miss but they had potato, baked beans and a selection of fruit and cereal every day (I always bring my own soy milk). The restaurant was excellent value for money and provided lots of nice Thai food. I would definitely recommend this resort for a relaxing weekend. Fiona P wrote a review Feb 2019\n",
      "30 Pleasant location, helpful staff but in need of renovation We stayed for two nights in December. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the location is very pleasant with plenty of greenery and ocean views.  The rooms really need renovation, and it is obvious this hotel has been around for many years.  Bathroom facilities are adequate, but again showing age.

      "50 Exactly what you need for a quick weekend getaway with your little one It took us a long time to come to this place as we do not particularly like Pattaya. When we finally visited we were so glad, it truly is a little paradise hidden in Pattaya, green lush beautiful, traditional Thai resort with beautiful garden and trees, many kid oriented things (jumping, rabbits, slides) and a great little beach which was very clean. Great food and views at the restaurant and we loved the social enterprise concept. Rooms are traditionally simple Thai style, functional and practical for us to have 1 double bed for us and 1 single bed for our daughter. And the best part, only 2 hours door to door to Bangkok on a Sunday evening! Diana C wrote a review Nov 2018\n",

      "20 Nice hotel is not maintained anymore The hotel is too expensive for the quality you get. The two pools (one for the kids) and the location is the best part of the hotel. The rooms are ok but old. Wireless internet is available but not very strong and stable. You need to login a couple of times during the day. The rest is not really taken care of e.g broken bicycles were kids can injure themselves easily because of missing pedales and rusted mudguards. The restaurant seems to be overpriced for avaerage quality food.  It seems that the owner had a good idea but the management is not reall trying to keep the good standard. We will definitley not come back. jkiyek wrote a review Aug 2018\n",

      "50 Excellent family retreat with a stunning view We enjoyed our stay at this resort! It ticked a lot of the boxes you wish you get when booking online and hope you choose well;-).    Well located at beachfront. Maintainted property and lush small garden. Although, with the tropical atmosphere is hard to keep it up, but no major flaws. Reception very adequite and friendly. Nice big pool with a small kids area connected. View absolutely stunning! There is also a seperate baby pool but we did not use that.  The resort is a small drive away from the famous ‘Walking Street and Beach Road’.    As a family with teenagers, we stayed in 2 rooms in the Villa’s. Very nice, clean and spacious rooms. Breakfast has enough selections to choose from. The restaurant is well prices, fresh, local and international dishes. The location of the restaurant is a treat! Different levels to sit with just a welcoming breeze from the ocean. We loved eating here. Some curious birds awaiting you might drop some food... just a joy!    Overall, an excellent choice if you look for a treat in Pattaya. Jurma S wrote a review Jul 2018\n",
      "40 Reasonable price good service in the middle of Pattaya city Best for family vacation. Nice garden and retreatment. There are some rabbits in the garden so our children can play with them. Good restaurant just next door, Cabbages & Condoms. One of the best sunset view in Pattaya. tawiwat wrote a review Jul 2018\n"

      "40 Had a nice time Nice place to stay away from all the chaos of Pattaya. Friendly staff and clean rooms set in idyllic quiet surroundings. We didn't try the restaurant but there were a few just outside the resort which did decent quality food. Taxis wait outside though we walked most places or took baht buses. Breakfast was decent and plentiful. The grounds are beautiful and green you wouldn't think you were in a city with shrubberys and herb gardens to wander around. The pool was nice though as previously mentioned but did allow children to play in it even though there was a kids pool elsewhere on the grounds with slides etc. Lots of squirrels to watch jumping from tree to tree which was nice. All in all a good place to stay. Rich S wrote a review Mar 2018\n",
      "30 Paradise Found......& Lost We came for peace &, quiet having been for lunch once before and found the setting idylic amongst the madness that is Pattaya. Our room was as expected with a great view of the pool. A drawcard for us was that there is an adult pool and a great kids pool for families to enjoy. We had a great 2 days of R&R and decided to extend our stay. We enjoyed the food in the restaurant (something for everyone) even inviting friends from other hotels to come join us. Throughout the resort some staff are friendly and engaging and others appear quiet miserable but we didnt let that bother us. Sadly for us the relaxation bubble burst when the adult pool filled with kids 2 days in a row. The first day the kids were moved on after a couple of hours and numerous guest complaints. The second day was a free for all so we moved out and went down the beach which is not unpleasant. We had thought to go take over the kids pool to see how they would like it! I don't think management can enforce an adults only pool so dont come like us and expect peace and quiet by the pool because you'll be disappointed with the kids non stop screaming. I should point out the kids pool is quite spectacular and specifically designed with fun in mind so quite surprising they don't use it. We decided not to extend again and not sure if we will return....a kids free pool area is a deal breaker for us. The first 2 days of relaxation and good food here will always remain a great memory tho! InigoJones007 wrote a review Feb 2018\n",
      "10 Overpriced and not very good Went to Cabbages and Condoms with my husband last night (was staying opposite at The Asia) and thought the meal was nowhere near as good as the little restaurant at the front of the entrance and each meal was only 40 to 60 Baht as apposed to hundreds of Baht plus ++ at Cabbages and Condoms and not in the same class as the other place. The food was mediocre to say the least if not rather poor and have come to Thailand for 3 weeks to taste food from famous restaurants including Michelin starred places in Bangkok and street food and I know a little about food as I am a cook of Thai food (see Soodsawat). I wouldn't recommend this place for food but do not know what the resort of Birds and Bees is like.  SOODSAWAT soodsawat wrote a review Jan 2018\n",
      "40 Excellent quirky hotel with good facilities in its own paradise Beautiful large rooms well equipped. Beautiful surroundings and a paradise of its own and like one other review said you don’t realise you’re in a city setting when here you’re in heaven. The greenery and the rivers and fish and the restaurant / bar and the pool area, not to mention the private beach mean you can really switch off and unwind here.    We had some disappointment with the restaurant and found it a little on the pricey side and my only other criticism is the Wi-Fi did not work in our apartment (room) and we had to resort to using 3g on mobiles (costly) which wasn’t ideal as we both needed to be contactable as we work in IT and we left feedback about the Wi-Fi being poor when we checked out.    We would go back to this hotel if we were to come back to Pattaya as it was quite unique and supports a good cause (funding and supporting education and schooling in northern Thailand with some of the proceeds).    If you’re the prudish type, you should be aware the restaurant onsite is called cabbages and condoms and there are decorations galore made from condoms and contraceptives. Tastefully done however so this did not bother us!    I would give this hotel five stars if they improved their Wi-Fi and looked at their menu availability and pricing in the restaurant. Lunches were especially on the pricey side and some lower cost lunch options would not go amiss. My only criticisms, but not enough to deter us both wishing we could have stayed longer!

The breakfast is also very pleasant. Forget about the western breakfast (that in Thailand is difficult find good) to but go for the unusual staff , like baked spinach or baked pumpkin . The pools and the beach is also very relaxing Simona001 wrote a review Nov 2017\n",
      "20 Cabbages and Condoms let us down We have been several times to this restaurant and always enjoyed the food, but on this occasion the food was awful, if you can believe it, bearing in mind we are in Thailand, the food was tasteless, the rice overlooked and stodgy. Although we are aware that it costs a little more at this place due to its charitable nature, the prices charged (in light of what we got) was expensive to say the least. The venue and staff remain as pleasant as ever. Unfortunately I don't think we will go again to this place, which is a shame. WendyBManchester wrote a review Oct 2017\n",

Beyond the location, the beach, the cleanliness of the place, the kindness and efficiency of the personnel, the spirit of the project, the surrounding wild life, the quality of the accommodation, the amazing humor of the sign posts there is this indescribable atmosphere which makes you love the place within the first minutes. A place to go despite sometimes a decoration which is slightly over the top :-)  Close to Varuna and golf courses and far away enough from Pattaya center you cannot go in that area without spending some time in that hotel. Fantastic really. AppleThomery wrote a review Aug 2017\n",
      "40 For a relaxed retreat amid nature A cute place with nature at its focus. The place is easy on the pocket and the property is beautiful: An escape from the party hub of Pattaya. Location is good, lots of cabs parked outside the resort. English language, like at a lot of places in Pattaya, is an issue, but use your phone to translate. The family mart outside the resort comes in handy, another seven eleven is a few meters away. Snigdha A wrote a review Aug 2017\n"

      "50 Wonderful location A wonderful location in a lush garden away from the hustle from downtown pattaya. But very easy to get to the party arria if you want to go. Looking at the negative comments on this site about this hotel I want to say the following. Yes the hotel is probably one if the first \"resorts\" at the south beach. And you can see that but in a positive way. If you want to stay in a modern tower you are here at the wrong place. The big rooms facing the lush garden with rabbits who are jumping around in the evening. Little cascades surrounded by old trees. A wonderful decorated restaurant with decks on different levels. The food is a little bit more expensive than at street stalls but for this you have wonderful service and great quality.    Pool is dispite guest comments clean and the beds are comfortable with free clean towels. Always one person during the day take care of your drinks at the small bar at the pool. Taih service 100%    A great hotel with a great Taih touch and service in a grand old garden with a lot if kids activitys. The beach is almost private with free beds and towels. Regarding all comments at this site, again yes it is an older hotel with great atmosphere full service and for us as a family With young kids a place to return. jaapjz wrote a review Aug 2017\n",
      "30 On the decline Was certainly nice few years ago, but it's not anymore: the site is not well maintained, dirty and dusty. We went there mostly for the kids, they had fun but the kids pool was dirty, water not clear with seaweed on the walls, the sunbed mattress were mouldy, trampoline was out of order, the beach is dirty with plastic bottles (even the part in front of the hotel), I asked the staff why they don't clean it and no reply... Water is not so clear but same everywhere in Pattaya. The restaurant has a very weird decoration with condoms and contraception pills everywhere, kids were playing with that! They found only one rabbit in the garden... Restaurant serves correct thai food. A part of this, bedroom was ok, not fancy but clean, the family room is surrounded by water so we have to fight with lots of mosquitos. I won't come back. Julie M wrote a review May 2017\n",

The restaurant is good, the beach and pool are perfect. The only thing that lets it down slightly is the chalets. Though they were once cutting-edge, they are beginning to look a little tired and they do not impress the way you would want them to if you were treating a loved one to a romantic getaway or similar.

The entire grounds were immaculate. The included Breakfast Buffet had plenty to offer. Staff was friendly and helpful.  Family Mart (7/11 type shop) is next to the entrance for quick needs as are two pharmacies up the road in easy walking distance (they have a golf cart to take you). Taxis at Entrance on street.  The restaurant was tasty and affordable with great ocean views and breezes. I believe there are 4 eating decks to choose from.  Like Photography? Plenty of landscape and macro opportunities on the grounds and of the ocean and skies.  Great for families with kids. We spent the majority of time on the beach and the kiddie pool which was always and fun; Never crowded.  If you are wanting a place that isn't a high rise, elevators(lifts), standard hotel, then this is it. Plenty of green space everywhere.

      "50 5 Stars despite some languange challenges. This is a great hotel for families. There are two swimming pools and a small beach and lovely gardens that cater for a relatively peaceful family holiday where you can enjoy everything without going any further. The beach is relatively clean with several restaurants on it. These cater for basic, affordable dining and drinking. The hotel has spacious rooms that are quirky and perhaps dated in terms of interior decoration. However, everything is clean and in working condition.    Service is super friendly, but English remains a problem. Despite good intentions to help, the poor level of English is sometimes just too big a gap to ensure that you are understood. The garden is well kept and the pools are immaculate. Direct access to the beach and service on the beach end before sunset at around 6pm, which is sometimes regrettable as it is a lovely time to be on the beach. The breakfast buffet is a good spread of the stuff you need for breakfast, including eggs. Basic fruits are served, but you can order some fruit, like mango, at a price. The restaurant offers a great dining experience at night, especially the lower deck overlooking the sea.    If you want to visit places like walking street, floating market and night markets from here, then there is a cost involved to get taxis. So in terms of location, you are relatively isolated. However, in the street in front of the hotel, there are many dining and drinking options as well as laundry services (although hotel laundry is affordable) and massage / spas. I hope to visit them again soon ! Beejay80 wrote a review Mar 2017\n"

      "30 Good and bad It's a nice place in many ways, but there are a few annoying things. First, I hate paying forced service charges and VAT. Surely, when you book a hotel you are also paying for service, and all businesses have to pay VAT. These charges should be included in the price as is the case in all other types of service industries. But what is even worse here is that they charge 15% for certain services, and VAT on top of that. Absolutely disgraceful! Also, there are lots of clever-dick signs around the place which seem to suggest that the owner wants to be regarded as some kind of sardonic philanthropist, which is irritating when seen against the money-grubbing service charge policy he uses. Also, I think the condoms displayed everywhere in the restaurant, including right next to your food, are rather unappetizing. It could be an excellent place if they cleared away the extra charges, smartass signs and condoms, as it is clean and in a beautiful situation. Don S wrote a review Mar 2017\n",

Private pool and beach all the days I stayed in the pool and the beach you will never want to go out from this resort recommend for families and couples. For the food the breakfast is very good . For the dinner I use the taxi 200BHT to go out and to try the THi food which is cheap around 500 up to 800 for 3 person . The transport to the air port little high around 1400 THB but you can negotiate with the driver . It was amazing resort , only I have small issue with insects I use good product that will let the insect go a way . Remember partial of the resort income will go to the charity .  Next year for sure I will come back for a week.  Laundry near by as well 7 eleven ..and the resort will take you by small golf car just ask for it .. so will never walk any where around.

      "40 Perfect escape from BKK We stayed in the Birds & Bees during a bank holiday weekend when it was pretty booked out but the resort is cleverly laid out so didn't feel busy. The kids pool was great and has lots of different depths, showers & slides so suits all. The large trampoline next to the pool was a big hit too. The beach is not big but clean and with direct access from the hotel, sunbeds, sand to build in, sea you could swim in and a small bar we had no complaints.  Our room was pretty basic, but clean and functional and accommodated a family of 2 + 2 in three beds so fit the bill for a weekend where we only used the room to sleep and shower. There are other less basic room types available - we were in a 'garden room'.  The restaurant 'Cabbages & Condoms' is lovely with levelled decks looking over the sea so great in the evening and the food was excellent.  Only word of warning is there are condoms everywhere - on posters, under glass at breakfast & adorning mannequins! Not an issue with older kids but if you have youngsters be prepared for 100 questions!!  If you want an easy family escape from BKK for a few days where you don't need to go far from the resort then I would recommend. Janine M wrote a review Dec 2016\n",
      "50 Worth the stay It's just great.    I stayed here for 10 days during my vacation and it's just Supreme. It is very well kept and you don't have the feeling that you are in a city because of the location it is situated in.    If you're looking for piece and quiet then you have to come here. All the staff is very friendly and always there if you have any wishes.    The rooms are cleaned daily. They have a nice big pool or a private beach with free sunbeds for the guests of the resort. The beach is kept very clean from what I've seen on some places in Thailand. The WiFi is very good in every corner of the resort even on the beach.    Also I have to say there are no hidden costs attached I've seen that some resorts charge you extra for the cleaning, electricity, water and so on.    All in all a great place to enjoy and relax. Alone with your partner or family. I would definitely recommend it and personally I'm looking forward to my next visit. Matej Š wrote a review Dec 2016\n"

      "50 Peace and harmony I don't really know how to describe this place but I'll try and I'll use some pictures as well.    The facilities are just amazing. The pool by the private beach are to die for. There's sun from sunrise till sunset. So if you want a tan and don't want the noise from pattaya, I couldn't recommend a better place.    The walk from the reception to our room is a journey trough the \"jungle\" path and there's signs you have to read. Some of them are so funny.    At night the \"wildlife\" are emerging and we went for a stroll round the resort to find new animals. Mostly lizards, frogs and some other spices.  Be ware of the mosquitos!    The restaurant cabbages & condoms have a beautiful view from the treetop deck over the sea. Is quit a romantic place to eat your breakfast and dinner. Mikkel H wrote a review Dec 2016\n",
      "50 Wonderful weekend getaway! We spent a wonderful weekend here. Resort is a verdant beach oasis with lots of personality. Room is very spacious & clean, strong AC, comfy bed, very nice bathroom. Full buffet breakfast, lots of choices, tasty & delish. Restaurant has good view of the sea. Lush landscaped grounds including organic orchard with fruits & veges. Resort is socially responsible enterprise and runs a school for poor children which until recently was located right on the premises, now moved to larger site. Planning to return soon!

      "40 Restaurant review only! Spectacular setting, decent food, service OK Have had dinner here three times. One was a company function, and two couple dinners. Last time we have dined here in August.  Food: OK. The plus - you can find some not so common Thai dishes which are of good quality. The minus - the western dishes I had were average when compared to other places in Pattaya;  Service: OK. Some times really good, at other times average. It depends on the waitress / waiter;  Setting: Very nice. The feeling is great, the place is quiet and the sound of the waves makes everything perfect. The garden is very nice and the overall feeing whilst wondering about the garden is quite pleasant.  I recommend the place. Worth going there one time. Probably not gourmet enough to become a regular dining place, but good for a date, event or family dinner. Winedeng wrote a review Sep 2016\n",
      "20 Disappointed with new management after years of happy visit Been with my family to birds and bees recently. They are under new management now, and things changed a bit, unfortunately not to the better.    Have been staying in all kinds of rooms over the years from the 2 br royal cliff, bugs family room, normal room everything. I always come here for family weekend escapes as it is not from Bangkok and with their 2 pools, the restaurant and the beach it was a good family weekend trip. I never had any complaint and staff was always friendly until now.    When arriving the room was not yet ready, not a big thing so we went to the beach, showing them the paper we had received at the reception and after an unfriendly inspection we were waived through. The beach was except one other family empty so at least 10 empty sun lounges. We picked ours and before we got the towels had to show the receipt again. The trouble started when we asked for a thris lounge for our son ( was was a registered guest in our room at the age of 2) we were told we can only have 2 with our room (this time a standard room as no other room was available). I could not believe what I heard, we are paying registered guest of the hotel and not get a sun lounge out of the 10 available. When the beach boy called the front office we were told of we need 3 we had to pay extra? I have never ever heard of such a bullocks and have had 3 or more sun lounges on many trips here. After severe protests they finally granted us a third beach chair (they claim themselves as a family resort). When examining the beach closer I realized how dirty it was. I know pattaya is never a clean beach but in the last 4 years when I came here the staff at cleaned up their patch of the beach on the morning. Very clearly this haven't been done for a long time as there was a thick line of rubbish on the sand with all kinds of rubbish Including glass bottles, the next down side.    When we got to the room I was disappointed again, tiny room with very old futniture latterly no light at all and mold in the shower. 2 tiny pillows. When asking if here is another room got a rude Awnser    I really loved birds and bees but this time I am really disappointed. I learned there is new management, I can only hope that this type of service will not last, only reason for 2 stars is that the low season price is quiet fair. However after 4 years of regular trips to this place I will now explore other options in pattayas for my Bangkok weekend trips. Sad but true that this former germ has adopted the attidute of the beach chair vendors on pattayas main beach. DennisT78 wrote a review Sep 2016\n",
      "40 Wonderful Stay We were a big group of 22 people aging from 3 to 72. Stayed there for 3 nights in 5 rooms and 2 suites (Big Bee and Big Bug). It was a wonderful stay.  Perfectly located for us, away from main city but not too far. Wonderfully decorated rooms, very nice walkways, 2 swimming pools, pleasant breakfast. The kids play area and the rabbits were the attraction for the kids.  However, would love to see 25 THB charge exempted for the lost tea spoon. My only disappointment.  Must stay. war_rahman wrote a review Aug 2016\n",
      "40 Nature gateway for family in Pattaya Situated a little away from the central of Pattaya, nestled in a tropical rain forest , this resort was the highlight of our great family trip. Taxis and Songthaews are easily available from the resort's gate. 7-11, family mart is within 5 min walking distance.    Kids loved the resort. The suits are perfect for families with children. The kids pool is awesome so is the main pool. Rooms were nicely decorated with high quality bedding.    Breakfast served in their famous Cabbages and Condoms restaurant was good enough. The view from the restaurant was also amazing. Food in the restaurant is little expensive but tasted good.    Staff were prompt and efficient but didn't find them very cordial as you generally find in any boutique resort.    Overall it was a very nice stay and would recommend to anyone.

      "30 Good location for holiday on private beach, jacuzzi tub and pool with delicious food at the hotel This place is closed to Pattaya; a busy town and beach, but it is totally another way around here. It is Quiet, a lot of trees and peachfull enviroment once you walk into the hotel. Food is delicious as Cabage and Condom kitchen won't disapponted you.    In the room is quite an old style decoration but clean with quality facilities. Only one thing that disappointed me is double bed was made from 2 single beds push together and clovered it with out support ontop. I had problem to sleep on it. In the morning, I had to go to the reception to ask them fix it. And apparently they fix it for me right away which is made me happy with them Nantakan S wrote a review Aug 2016\n",
      "50 A little piece of heaven in Pattaya. Have eaten in the restaurant many times over the past 10 years and this April decided to stay in the hotel for 2 nights. Very friendly reception staff, you feel like your arriving in a 4/5 star hotel not a 3 star. The rooms are very basic, but have everything you need, but you will not be spending much time in the room, as the pools and grounds are truly stunning. Will be returning this August with my 7 year old daughter, for 3 nights as it's her favourite place in Pattaya and it's easy to see why. Fashionman68 wrote a review Jul 2016\n"

      "50 An amazing find I had a couple of days to kill but didn't want the full-on Pattaya experience. I was so delighted to book this place. It's like a little oasis, or a jungle really. It's a world apart from Pattaya. There is a private beach, a good pool and a fabulous breakfast. The staff were fabulous and and environs just make for a great stay. There are local taxis available outside the hotel but they will overcharge you for sure. We had our own car which makes life much easier.  We stayed in a standard room which was just fine even if a little musty.  (For the hotel manager, please warn guests of the step down from the toilet to the shower area. It's a little dangerous.)

      "40 Great pocket of tranquility Birds and Bees resort is a peaceful place in the midst of chaotic and dirty Pattaya. Pattaya has a shady reputation, and on first glance you might think this place embodies all that due to its name. You could not be more wrong.  Birds and Bees (along with Cabbages and Condoms) is driving community health and development programs and the names are chosen to reduce the stigma these words usually trigger. E.g. Cabbages and Condoms was chosen because the founder wanted condoms to be as common a word as cabbages in order to promote safe sexual conduct.  The resort itself is beautiful, with an infinity pool right next to their own stretch of beach. I would stay in the pool, as the water outside Pattaya is very dirty.The rooms are simple, clean and spacious.  While the resort is nice the surroundings are less than picturesque. As soon as you step out their front gate you will be in a very different world, with poverty on every corner. But this, unfortunately, is quite common in Thailand and should not take away from the resort itself. Arne wrote a review Feb 2016\n",

      "30 A nice little spot... It's a nice little resort for families with young children. As well as a nice adult pool, it's got a really well thought out area with three kids pools of varying depths and shaded half-cabanas that offer a full view so you can relax and watch the kids wherever they play. There's a great trampoline that attracts a lot of attention from the children.    The two friendly rabbits in the garden are also a real wow and sure to be a favourite with all the kids.    Housekeeping services were excellent. Friendly, fast and efficient .  The rooms are basic but clean, plenty of towels and a spacious shower.    Wifi is free. It's not the quickest but it's ok.    The food is good, not high end but an excellent selection and what they do, they do well. Breakfast is good and I love the fact that you get your own toaster on the table so no standing around in the \"Toast Queue\".    There is a small semi-private beach that is clean and with a nice swimming area.    The public toilets (and this isn't something I would normally write about) were just excellent. Well designed with a rainforest theme, spotlessly clean, good products. I was really impressed and other guests mentioned them too.    We liked the resort's ethical standpoint and the commitment to local charities.    The only reason that I haven't given it more stars (and the reason we won't be going back) was the service in the restaurant. It was simply terrible. No greeting, no smiles, tables set incorrectly, no thank you, no order check, no one checking the meals were ok. As well as long waits for food, dishes came out incorrectly and were lukewarm. It's a real shame as otherwise it would be a great spot, but if you need to use their F&B (as a family we often avoid going out in Pattaya as we don't like the raucous nature of the city) then you will be subjected to this as we were for 3 meals a day for two days. It's honestly like they are going out of their way to be unfriendly. It's a shame.    Overall - go if you want a little family escape not far from Bangkok and you are eating out. They've got some nice things and we thought it was value for money. Don't go if service matters. Simon M wrote a review Feb 2016\n",

      "40 Relaxing We have just come from a 2 night stay.    Overall it was very good, we really enjoyed this place.    On arrival they didn't have our reservation, the lady was very abrupt and not very welcoming at all, I found this very off putting as this was the start to our stay. She then went on and said well you can still have the room but you have to pay again!! (After telling her I had already paid!) I phone the travel agent and it was all sorted out within a few minutes I was just annoyed she was trying to get me to pay again knowing full well I had already paid!    We had a a little villa by the pool, it was clean and had everything you needed in it. (A little pricey for what it is) but still it was lovely. Only thing we really had trouble with was the bed it was very hard and had trouble sleeping.    My little boy loved the kids pool, the main pool was also lovely and relaxing was never really busy (which is always a bonus) the man by the pool that looked after it was very friendly :)    The restaurant was very quirky, food was always very tasty and the breakfast was also really good to be fair.    The grounds are also very picturesque.    We wanted to stay longer but just couldn't do another night on that bed. All in all was a very relaxing stay :) Tamlyn R wrote a review Jan 2016\n",
      "30 Good food / nice atmosphere This hotel had a great setting surrounding by naturals. Both pools look nice and clean, kid play ground, bunny camp etc.    The restaurant that attached to this hotel I have been ate here quite a few times past couple years and its happens to be this absolute disgrace, rude, obnoxious and extremely unhelpful staff who's name is Khun Mhee that took care of our table.    We arrived approx 2.30 p.m. today (December 28,2015). All customers were leaving. This girl came over took us to the corner table which couldn't see any view. What's for ?    So,my overseas friends kinda shock when we ask her to change table for the better view which was still dirty from previous customers. Then she set a table for 2 people and walked over to set up other long table for previous customer with 8 peoples.    After I saw she did that I asked her politely if we could have one more table and 2 chair at the table we were standing at. The answer was NO this is restaurant setting I will not change for you *%^%#@ .    She then walk away and left us right there. This was the same girl that served us last time as well. She really NOT have any service mind and not suitable with front end customer. The place she should be is Back Office.    I walked over asking for Restaurant Manager and #Khun Wao assisted me immediately,help us move other table and chairs and apologize for those rudely colleague.    After we sat down ordered food and drink everything back to normal again. Khun Mhee (trouble & none service mind girl) avoided our table at all cost. Service was not very good here. I had to get up a few times to top up our steam rice and order more drinks.    After paid the bill, I walked forward to Khun Wao to make sure that trouble negative attitude girl needed to know what she have done to us today and the previous visited.    Food we ordered ;    1.Tom Kha Kai : Coconut milk soup with chicken was excellent.  2.Chicken with Pandans wraps was very good,meat marinaded and juicy  3.Fried Spring rolls was quite nice.  4.Stir fried morning glory was good.  5.Papaya salad with Seafood was a bit spicy than I expected (asked for less spicy).  6. Fish cake was excellent (not too spicy and full of favor)  7.Watermelon juice, Pineapple juice,whole coconut juice and Lime soda was very good.    Price was very fair even they added 7% Tax and 10% service charge. The bill was only 1,950 THB for 4 persons we considered that was a fair price.    If the beverage manager of this hotel ever read this place do something with your service staffs. They needed serious training. By adding 10% service charge on us,we expected way lots more that we have got today and previous visit. 0_Gyrfalcon_0 wrote a review Dec 2015\n"

      "40 Really good stay in Pattaya I arrived late on Friday evening, my friends had arrived earlier in the day. I stayed in a Deluxe twin room (712) which was on the ground floor and very close to the swimming pool. The room was very big, clean, well maintained and had everything I needed. The beds are comfy and the air con works well.    Breakfast is great, lots of choice, toasters and bread on each table. Service can be a bit slow so be patient.    For lunch and dinner, the restaurant is great. There is Thai and Western food. I recommend the stir fried chicken with holy basil and chilli with a fried egg on top - yum!

The gardens are kept immaculate with fat rabbits playing happily or dosing in the shade. Everywhere there is something of interest or to make you smile or place just to think and breath.

I had lost interest in the monotony of the usual hotel settings and going for a swim at the beach had to be done at the Koh Larn island, which was expensive and too risky.    Birds and Bees is actually a hidden gem in Pattaya. Accommodations are set within a forest-like garden. It has a private beach with a desk and personnel that supply you with lotion, towels, etc. masseuses are on hand to give you a soothing rub down and you have the best scenes of the beach for the ideal facebook profile pic .

      "40 Good family gateway We stayed in B&B over a week-end (2 nights), in two regular garden rooms (priced 2150 THB/room/night).  The resort is easily accessible from Bangkok, about a 3h drive door to door during rush hour.    The rooms are worn off and do need to be renovated, but we found the overall experience to be good value for money.  This is due to the amazing common areas and location. Lush tropical garden, adult swimming pool overlooking the sea and an island, kids' pool with three slides, rabbit village, trampoline, private beach with space between guests, restaurant levelled above the beach.  Very kids friendly. Most guests during our stay were families with young children (you never know in Pattaya what kind of public you'll see in hotels).  Another plus is the involvement of the resort with local communities (cleaning beaches, agricultural village for kids, etc.).  On the downside, and besides the room's refurbishment needed, restaurant prices are rather high for the quality provided (+you have to add another 17% on the shown prices for taxes and service).  Even if not everything is of high quality, breakfast buffet offers plenty of choices and is overall decent: your choice of eggs, bacon, sausages, hash brown, pasta, baked spinach with cheese, pork dumplings, fried rice, fried bananas, pancakes, multigrain bread, smoothies, etc.    Overall a keeper for short family escapes.

We stay in this holet for only 2 nights , but unfortunately we WILL NOT GO there again , it is a shame that you have such a beautifull facility , but the rooms are in very bad conditions.  We decide to go to this hotel , aftel we went some months aggo to have lunch in the restaurant of this hotel. The surrounding are just amaizing. Explain bellow:  Positive :  - the swimming pool , beautiful, just perfert for you and your kids  - the privat beach that they have , it is amaizing , you just go down some stairs and your there , with all that you need , sunbed & towels are available.  - the garden is just perfect , and the rabbits that are just wondering around are the best toys for your kids , also you can find some chiken that are also free close to the packing area, so nice for the kids.  - the restaurant was nice , like a told you this was one of the reason that we go there.  - the breakfast , was ok  Negative:  - the rooms are very old & worn-out , VERY VERY BAD CONDITIONS. in the second day we even found many ants in our bed , we asket then to change the bad sheet and they made that, just like in 5 min after asking.  - the bathroom VERY VERY BAD , and we stayed in a Delux Room ! , all worn-out and dirty. the second day the smeel in the bathroon was terribile , the smeel of a mold :(, fortunatelly we left !  - the Wifi ....which Wifi ? can not use ! we try all the available connections available , nothing ! you can not even open your e-mail , and skype forget it :(  - the AC , bad , very old and noisy and not enough power to cool down the room.  Overall :  - we pay 3,600/night with discount from 5,200 !!! , with this price any other hotel will be above this hotel . It is a shame !  - This place can be the best place to travel with your kids , all the surroundings is made for that . Except the rooms which are totally not recommended for kids!    For the management of this hotel : just ...... SHAME ON YOU, somebody build this hotel with so healthy & positive thinking , but you just let all worn-out.

      "40 Perfect family escape close to Bangkok Ideal for relief from the stress, crowds or grime of Bangkok and Pattaya. We stayed for three days and barely left, as there's the beach, kids' pool, rabbits and playthings that kept the kids entertained.    The Cabbages and Condoms restaurant was fantastic and breakfast buffet not too bad.    We ventured out to Pattaya once and realised its not at all appealing - seedy and full of the ugly expat/boozy tourist crowd or questionable Russian \"businessmen\". We'll definitely go back to coco ourselves for a weekend again though.    Wifi not great, but not important for us. Important to time your arrival and departure to avoid the excessive traffic along the freeway between Bangkok and Pattaya. Andrew R wrote a review Mar 2015\n",
      "50 Beautiful One of the most beautiful resorts I've been too. We had a standard room which was dated and had no view at all, but spacious and clean. What you are paying for are the fantastic communal spaces - the restaurant is stunning, the Childrens pool is perfect, with fabulous shaded cabanas all around and even a table area for eating lunch. My 3 year old loved the trampoline, the rabbits and digging in the sand on the private beach. The sea is as you would expect in Pattaya, murky and with plastic bags etc floating around - but that is not the hotels fault - and you don't need to swim in the sea with such beautiful pools. Breakfast was good selection of western/Thai options, with your own toaster at each table. We ate at the resort for lunch by the pool and dinner, I really wouldn't recommend the cheeseburger but otherwise it was fine, maybe a little disappointing given the fact that it's famous as a restaurant, but you're paying for the setting and the ethos behind it so I didn't mind too much that my tom yum goong was deeply average!  I would totally recommend this to families with children - they and you will love it, and there's plenty to do in the general area if you don't want to spend all day in the beautiful surroundings of Birds and Bees. sah79 wrote a review Mar 2015\n"

      "50 Peace and tranquility in a very hectic town Totally secluded away from the frantic lifestyle that is Pattaya where it is possible to relax unmolested by the usual holiday hustle. From the minute you travel down the drive to reception you feel like you are in a protective bubble and the staff are very friendly and helpful throughout. Accommodation is in various settings amongst tree lined paths around a large lawned area where the friendly rabbits abound. Depending on the size of your party relates to which flexible room arrangements you have and this works well. Lovely infinity pool area and hot tub which leads down to a private beach where again staff are there to sort out towels, sun beds and umbrellas plus snacks and drinks. The restaurant (Cabbages and Condoms) is arranged on several different level up the face of the cliff giving glorious views of the beach below. Food is of a very high standard served by friendly staff. We ate here every day of our five night stay. We did venture into town once but not for long and hurried back to calm. The resort and restaurant are the owners brain child into helping improve family life for the less well off people in more remote areas of Thailand and carries its own message. Well worth a visit.

      "20 Standard rooms not worth the money I was planning to stay at B&B for more than a month, but as standard rooms are very old and worn, then decided to leave earlier    Pros:  - The location and the surrounding park + the sea and pool area    Cons:  - Standard rooms are very small, there is no place for your things  - The room is very old and worn, walls and ceiling really need a paint-job, cupboard is broken; there is no hot water from the sink, etc.  - The aircon was very old and making a lot of noise so they changed it, which was very nice, but why would you change something only after customer tell you about it? Don't people responsible for customer service notice anything there for themselves?  - Wifi is working quite poorly in rooms and there is a stupid system for login that changes every couple of days. Come on, open up the wifi free to everyone - nobody will come there to steal your internet!!  - When I told the reception that I want to check out earlier they made me pay one day extra. Nobody even asked why I was leaving, i.e. they do not care about you, they only care about the money.    I think the standard room is clearly overpriced for the price asked, spetsialist if you're planning to stay for a longer period. Actually anything below Deluxe rooms is not worth staying in, but as they do not offer decent discounts for longer stays, it is also not worth the money.    For the manager of the resort I would recommend read Fred Reicheld's \"Ultimate Question\", a book about good profits vs bad profits and about really understanding customer experience.

      "40 A lovely resort in an intolerable part of Thailand A truly lovely family resort close to Bangkok, you can't believe they have such a nice set of bungalows in Pattaya, which is famous for not having any beaches to speak of. They have a great pool at this resort, as well as a jacuzzi, and a nice select strip of beach on the guarded peninsula. We had a very enjoyable weekend. The kids loved the bunnies running around the property, as well as the trampoline and camaraderie of other children. We were there during the winter month of January, so the pool was chilly, but during the hot season it likely is a relief. The food is also a great value, as we ended up eating every meal at Cabbages and Condoms. It all goes for a good cause! Tim H wrote a review Jan 2015\n",
      "50 Paradise Birds + Bees Resort is a hidden gem within the very vibrant Pattaya. The staff are friendly, the food in Cabbages + Condoms restaurant is amazing and lying around the pool with a book was so relaxing and exactly what I was after. There isn't one negative thing I have to say about Birds + Bees, it's 100% worth a stay if you're in Southern Thailand. I ventured out of the resort once in three days (to go to a Cabaret) and I could have stayed longer.I would recommend this resort to anybody wanting a bit of peace and relaxation in Thailand. Plus, it's all for a worthy cause (look up how Cabbages + Condoms first came about). JMFUk wrote a review Jan 2015\n",
      "40 Dinner Lovely resort. Beautifully located restaurant right at the edge of the sea. Excellent menu choice and food well prepared and presented. However, there was not enough time given between courses. When this was brought to the attention of the waitress an apology was given blaming the kitchen which I would agree. The kitchen also sent a dish which hadn't been ordered and didn't provide a dish that we had. Not good enough coming from a high class establishment as this. The Kitchen staff need to lift their game. However that said, the food was very good and well worth a visit. There is also some history to this venue. Keith M wrote a review Jan 2015\n",
      "40 Excellent escape from BKK All in all, this is a great spot and we'll definitely be back. It could be made even better if management fixed the issues below.    This resort is particularly good if you want peace and quiet and you are OK to stay in most of the time. If you are planning to go to town a lot, then don't go here.    The good:    -While not cheap, the rooms are relatively good value for money; not so much for the rooms themselves (they are not design-magazine-worthy or anything) but for the gardens and beach.    -Really beautiful gardens and semi-private beach. Exceptionally gorgeous restaurant with reasonable prices (except for coffee...)    -Pleasant staff, everybody seems happy to work here.    -Free wifi that actually works flawlessly.    The bad:    -Some of the best spots are closed to the public for big chunks of the day. I have no idea why. The beautiful terrace right on top of the waves? It only opens at 5:30PM, before that, you can't enjoy it. The wonderful beach? It closes around 6PM. They actually put a lock on the gate. The pool closes at 7PM too. It's a bit funny to pay 125+ euros a night and be barred access like that...    -When both beach and restaurant are closed, which is early...there is nothing to do at the resort, or in the area. The street outside is back to Pattaya reality...ie awful. You are also relatively far from the city itself.    -A double espresso here is 170 bhats. Even Starbucks, the king of overpriced coffee, does not dare to charge more than 80 bhats for a double espresso. (To be fair, everything else is priced OK.)    -The breakfast buffet is no good. Low quality food compared to what is served in the restaurant in the evening. Even the bacon is barely edible. I'd suggest to limit the choices but up the quality.

      "40 Close to nature Birds and Bees is a very nice place, great location, peaceful, with good food. Rooms are comfortable and the pool is really very nice. The rabbits are very friendly. Cute place. Nice location for relaxing with the family. We've been there three times over the years. I like the social business part of it as well. Sohail A wrote a review Dec 2014\n",
      "50 The secret hideaway you won't believe such tranquil place exist in Pattaya. Birds and Bee is Probably the most tranquil spot in Pattaya where u can rest and relax amidst the natural tropical garden settings. It has secluded private beach. A lovely place to be when you need privacy, tranquility and hide away from busy Pattaya. Jeeruna wrote a review Dec 2014\n",
      "50 Sprawling island of tranquility & deliciousness amid Pattaya After driving through much of overdeveloped Pattaya to arrive, we couldnt help but be surprised by the lush, yet simple reception area of Birds & Bees. Pools, waterways, bridges, lawns and lots of tropical greenery are wonderfully landscaped throughout the resort to create a setting that truly transports you far from Pattaya or Bangkok. This place is ideal for kids and parents alike. The two swimming pools, one that has 4 different depth pools for different size kids not to mention slides and fountains and shaded areas are a lot of fun. Then there is the giant trampoline that can bring out the kid in all of us, throw in some swings, lawns with roaming bunnies, waterways full of Koi fish, and a nice semi-private beach and the kids are running around all day until collapsing into bed at night. For parents and couple alike there are well placed benches and seating areas around the grounds from which to watch the tykes or a striking sunset over the ocean. And one of the highlights has to be the restaurant. With the same dishes from the famous Bangkok Cabbages and Condoms locale, the fare is creative and expertly prepared to please. The Kao Soi Gai (Northern Chicken Curry Noodles) I had there is still the best I have ever eaten. The restaurant setting helps set the mood with many tables on a large balcony overlooking the ocean and plenty of semi-indoor seating for the hot lunch sun. And for the quality and quantity offered, the food is an excellent value. We never left the resort for the 2.5 days we were there.  The rooms are nice as well with lush plants providing private front porch sitting areas all the modern amenities. We rented a two bedroom deluxe room near the restaurant For our two young kids, ourselves and a friend. When we return with just our family, I think a one bedroom will be plenty as they provide a crib free of charge.  We were very happy with the resort and especially for a very reasonable price. The only downside is that the gulf water is murky, but thats true all around the gulf. For an expat family in Bangkok this is a welcome, affordable, and easy weekend getaway. We will be back.

      "50 Such a romantic piece of paradise ... We attended a wedding at this wonderful resort and were absoutely blown away by the whole deal. The preparation personel and staff were wonderful and even the weather played its part. The entire wedding went off without a hitch and the staff were just superb.    The rooms are spacious and very comfortable, the food in the restaurant is top quality & the beach and two pools squeeky clean. I wish I could stay here longer and more often, but we will be back.

      "40 Two Nights in November The best thing about this hotel is the location. Despite being situated in a very commercialized place it feels as if that you are staying away from it all in a secluded resort.  The grounds and location to the beach are excellent. eleanor wrote a review Nov 2014\n",
      "50 Excellent hide away that you can afford!! We celebrated our 11 years of wedding anniversary there with our kid and our parent. This hotel can give all of us great time.

      "40 Better than expected We had lot of expectations when coming to this resort which was not our first choice to begin with but when reading a lot of the reviews we decided for the Birds & Bees. We choose the Big Bird Suite as we had children and thought that this would be roomy enough and we would not be disappointed. It had two big rooms with sofas in both. A big double bed in one and a bunk bed in the other. There was 2 lavatories and 3 showers, one shower on the outside/inside. 2 flat screen tv:s and a good working AC which was really good during hot days and nights for our small one.    The surroundings where great. Really calm and relaxing. A big children pool next to the suite and a short walking distance (a couple of minutes) to restaurant and private beach. Our 3 year old really loved the children pool. The trees, fishes, rabbits. An oasis which made you feel relaxed and very calm during your stay. Loved everything about it. Perfect for families away from the ordinary turism and stress    Downside was the Wifi that was not very fast and also you got these tickets that should be valid for 3 days but sometimes they did not work at all and sometimes it dropped after just one day or a couple of hours    Breakfast was ok. Not more than that. But that does not affect me so much as I don't really think it is that important. I could always get it somewhere else if want and my son liked it.    Close to 7 elevens and famliy marts and only a short taxi ride to Pattaya ( 5 min?) which cost around 200bath.    I recommend this one if you are a family or in need of a nice quite stay.

      "40 Pretty Place, Nasty Area The grounds of this hotel are very pretty and a visit to their organic farm/garden is enlightening. The room I had was beautiful, lovely balcony overlooking garden/pool. The pool is refreshing and you can go down to the beach and swim and sunbathe there as well. I think the restaurant (Cabbages & Condoms) in Bangkok is better but the layout of the resort at the resort was interesting as it was built on different levels looking out at the sea. Once the restaurant closed (10pm) there was virtually no drink or food of any kind available. I don't understand why they don't operate a little bar for their guests. One is forced out and there is nothing of note near the resort - a lot of Russian bars only. If you want to go into the nasty town of Pattaya it will cost you $10 dollars each way. It really is the only place to go if you want to eat and drink outside resort. I would never go back to this area but if you do want to go then I would recommend staying at the Birds & Bees. The charitable work that is done by the \"owner\" of this resort and the various Cabbage & Condoms restaurants in Thailand is extremely worthwhile and is making a difference in educating children/teens from poor rural areas. The school on site is fantastic. I only have two complaints. There is a sign at the pool stating no reserving loungers but obviously that is not being complied with as a large group were putting out sunhats/books etc. on anywhere from 8-11 loungers first thing in morning but most didn't turn up at pool until around Noon. Not fair and the pool manager should have rectified this as those loungers were the only ones facing the sun and sea. My other complaint was the incredibly unfriendly Reception Manageress who was downright hostile. ALL other staff were lovely. Liz56TorontoON wrote a review Apr 2014\n",
      "50 Outstanding setting a truly relaxing location We stayed at tge Birds and Bees for 7 nights in the Big Bird Family Suite. We booked it all online through email and all wwnt smoothly.  Pattaya isnt really sold to the Australian market and we are so over Phuket that we thought we would take a chance on this resort.... We were so pleased that we did!  Firstly I have to acknowledge that yes Pattaya is as crazy as the reviews say but it has so much more to offer than Phuket... the language barrier was the main thing that got us as most people speak Thai or Russian and our english caused a few issues in trying to get back to B&B, once we had a business card with the address on it most taxi drivers were able to understand where we wanted to go:)  Back to the resort... the setting is absolutely breathtaking! So peaceful and relaxing. We made use of the private beach entrance and the kids pool most days as the numerous waterslides and incredible staff at the pool was flawless. Our 4 and 7 year olds loved the special attention they got every time they went through the pool area. There is a springfree trampoline, rocking horses, roaming rabbits who love being fed bananas (which you help yourself to at the entrance/exit to the restaurant) and endless walkways with wishing wells and fish to feed.  One day our little one fell over while running (as they do!) And she tore many layers off the top of her toe, we quickly took her to the reception where we were greeted with outstanding support and instant first aid without hesitation. .. for that we were so grateful!  The room layout was fantsstic and the numerous showers and toilets were very handy too! The private decks and pond was just beautiful!  There were plenty of mozzies but a spray with the bug spray that is provided each night addresses that!  Thd beds are hugeand comfortable and there is plenty of room for sofa lounges and separate tv's for the kids and adults.  The staff were very pleasant but had very little English, however we managed well and they organised some outstanding tours for us. The free wifi and screenshots of the attractions we wanted to visit helped alot!  The only complaint we had was the breakfast, I think it was low season while we were there and we found that the beakfast buffet was getting worse and worse with each day that we were there as less and less variety was available. However dinner on the top level of the cabbages and condoms restaurant while watching the sun set over the gulf of Thailand was absolutely spectacular and our children still talk about it!  All in all im glad we took the risk on Pattaya as an Aussie family and the Birds and Bees made our trip so memorable. Definitely worth the extra money!  Thank you Birds and Bees!

      "20 They missed with their guest services. I will preface this review with a note that I have changed the way I look at a hotel. To be 5 star in my view it truly needs to be a flawless stay, possibly some of my past reviews would not do as well given my new method of reviewing. In reviewing, I will consider everything from ease of booking, to location. Check in and reception to room comfort. Bathroom amenities to towel quality. Lastly I will consider the responsiveness of the staff to issues. To that end, maybe I will gain some consistency in my review criteria.    The website is awful for trying to find prices and rooms. Booking was by phone and I was quoted two different prices by two different reservations personnel.    The location is great, just over the hill from Pattaya and away from the Pattaya mess.    Check in went smoothly and the front desk satff was polite. We had two rooms, the Big Bug suite for my son, mother-in-law and nanny and an Oceanside room for my wife and I. The rooms were moderately clean but not exceptional, they felt more like a lodge than a hotel, cobwebs and things hanging from the ceiling. The Big Bug suite did not have slippers so we had to get some because the floor just didnt feel clean.    The grounds were very nice but they seem to just miss, there is a playground for kids but it is a bit tired, there is a lawn with bunnies but it is watered so much that it is muddy. The walk ways are very nice but covered with berries that squish into your shoes. The beach is good enough.    The bathrooms were ok but not great, the towels were frayed and worn but clean.    The Ocean side room was very nice but also dark and a bit dirty.    The Big Bug suite lived up to its name. There were some big bugs in it. My 2 year old son was eaten alive by either mosquitoes or bed bugs and wound up with over 12 bites on his face. he had an allergic reaction and wound up in the hospital with a 102 degree fever. We can't be sure which insect got him but the bites did not look like mosquito bites.    Service was hit or miss, we ordered food from the restaurant to eat in our room and it took quite awhile, once it arrived it was good and well prepared.    We had a major issue with the staff and money as did other reviewers. One of the nights our nanny ordered food from the restaurant, she paid cash but signed the room receipt because the wiater told her she had to. Upon check out I was charged for the room service that she paid cash for. The two room service reciepts that we had were different also, on was marked credit and that one we clearly charged to the room, the one that was paid in cash was not marked credit but we were charged. I think the restaurant staff tricked our nanny into signing and then pocketed the cash. My son was in the car and running a high fever, we still had a 2 hour drive to Bangkok so I signed the bill and left, vowing to never return to this hotel.    The other thing that was annoying, when we checked out they checked the room and wanted to know where one of the glasses was. We used the glasses when we had room service and they were cleaned up with the dishes. The front desk satff seemed to be accusing me of stealing a 50 cent glass. It seems that if you pay more than $1200 for two rooms for two nights that you should be treated with more respect. I have no use for a cheap hotel glass. I find it hard to beleive that the clientel that will pay this much for a room is also fond of pilfering hotel glasses.    I wanted to like this hotel but it was overpriced, unresponsive, dishonest and dirty. Don't bother staying here, it's just not that great and may have bed bugs. For the amount they charge and the way a guest is treated...not again. ccham wrote a review Jan 2014\n"

From the reception there's a walkway through the jungle-style garden to the main resort. (A couple of nice suites are also located next to the reception, with private entrance to the family pool).    There are two pools; a family pool in the garden with slides, waterfalls, a fountain etc, and a cliff-side pool with a nice ocean view. Some rooms have in-room jacuzzi; very popular with the kids.

      "50 Paradise, with a message (and great food) The Birds and Bees resort is an oasis of peace and tranquility on the edge of Pattaya. The town of Pattaya has cleaned up quite a bit over the past years, but in the evening I would still not see it as a family location.    And that's where Birds and Bees is great; you can visit the town during the day (take a left at the main road), or go sailing from Pattaya's little yacht club, Ocean Marina (take a right on the main road!). And in the evening you can enjoy the great food. You really can't go wrong with any of the food-picks.  Quite some of the vegetables and herbs are grown next to the lodge.    And white rabbits are roaming free. Great to just sit at the pool and gaze at the ocean, or sit at the garden and look at the white rabbits hopping around.    Wonderful staff as well, all being from poorer villages of the North of Thailand, being taught English and about the hospitality industry to have skills to take back to the North. Apart from staff training, the money of the resort goes into building schools in the North and the lodge has its share of interesting and funny life-messages around politics, sustainability and family planning.

      "50 just gorgeous Once again I'm back at this lovely jewel of a place, a secret oasis, tucked away in Pattaya. Birds & Bees is a great place for families, couples and single people because there is something to interest all tastes and desires.  It is great to see so many families using the facilities, kids bonding together in a natural way, watching the tame rabbits, playing hide'n'seek in the gardens, frolicking on the beach or the kids' pool.  For anyone with an educational interest, the Mechai Pattana School has a branch in the grounds, and it is possible to visit the school and talk with the students by arrangement. The show garden is an interesting way to pass the time.  All in all, this is a great place to relax and refill your soul with energy. Judie2011 wrote a review May 2013\n",
      "40 Ideal for families First let me say Pattaya is not the best location for a family holiday but this hotel is. From the moment you see the rabbits running around in the tropical garden and the semi-private beach, you realise you have found somewhere a bit special. Another good sign is the ex-pat residents arriving in the evening to go to the restaurant, the food is Thai and very good. I would rather not to have to explain to my children what a condom is (there are 100's on display, thankfully in packets) but I do understand why they do it. Profits go to a foundation of some sort.

      "10 Ripping off their own guests! I was very pleased when we first arrived to the hotel. My children loved the jungles, the rabbits, and I've found all these signs very amusing. As this is our first time in Pattaya, we relied a lot on hotel reception for information about the place. However, whilst I was very grateful with their help, they were ripping us off with everything they helped to book for us!    The front desk helped us to book tickets for Tiffany's show. The ticket is abt 500-600 Baht, but they charged us 1000 Baht each. The next day we asked them to order a taxi for us to go to Rayong to visit our friends. They gave us the price of 3000 Baht. We asked them to phone the driver who we met a couple of days ago and check how much he would charge to go there, and they came back with the same price. We decided to use the driver we know and then they got back to us that they found someone who would charge us for 2600 Baht. And naively we went with the later choice.    It was not until later we found out through our Thai friend from the driver that he only charges 1500 Baht to go there, but the hotel staff asked him to collect 2600 Baht from us then of course hand over the 1100 Baht to them after he finished. And obviously, they probably didn't even call the other driver or just simply lied to us about the price!    They have a sign says 'Don't Steal - the government doesn't like the competition' but at the same time, their hotel staff are ripping off their own guests. We couldn't confront the hotel because the driver asks us not to say anything, otherwise he would never get any jobs with them ever again.    I just would like to warn anyone who is new to the hotel, the place that NOT to trust the smily faces at all! I'm not sure if the founder of this hotel is aware of what's going on here. Certainly it isn't correct for the hotel ripping off their own guests. If there was a charge for helping guests who stay in the hotel, then it should have been written down and signposted at the front desk!    I would never ever return or recommend Birds & Bees to anyone for this reason! My friends were very interested in this lovely little resort which most of the profits would go to help with schools in Thailand. We would love to give and help but certainly not while we are being ripped off!!! Fieye wrote a review Dec 2012\n"

It's very close to the Thai capital so is a very handy place for a quick beach getaway for a few nights or longer. It's also in Jomtien (Chom Tian) which is close enough to the bright lights of Pattaya if that's what you're after but also far enough away to be a lot more peaceful. The resort itself is very green with the buildings surrounded by many old trees. It's also right on the beach which is shared with only a couple of other hotels so it's fairly quiet. We would have no problems recommending this hotel for families. It has good facilities for young children, like a specialised pool and live rabbits roaming the grounds! The only criticisms we had were the service.. the staff didn't seem to be overly happy, which is unusual for Thai resorts. The breakfast buffet is very good, but the food at lunch/dinner is average and is nowhere near as good as Cabbages and Condoms in Bangkok. And don't order a Margarita! I've seen thimbles larger than the glass it came in. Not sure what the other cocktails were like because I didn't try any after that. But all in all, we would definitely return. The negatives mentioned above are minor in the grand scheme of things. WAHCO wrote a review Dec 2012\n",
      "50 birds & bees resort pattaya we have come to pattaya for my son's wedding on 1 nov 12 to 8th nov 12, so our whole family is here with 4 small kids. we have taken 7 rooms. the resort is very children friendly, the staff have been excellent, they have private beach which is just perfect with the kids. and two swimming pools one just for small kids and that just worked out perfect for us. we took the two family rooms which are just next to the kids swimming pool and it is like a private house with a pool and sitting room outside. the staff have been excellent, though their english should be improved, very few of them understood us easily Pushp V wrote a review Nov 2012\n",
      "50 Paradise Found This is my 5th stay at this charming resort - I keep coming back for more peace and quiet. I am always welcomed like a long lost friend and treated with the utmost courtesy; The room I am usually allotted is always spotless & well appointed. The restaurant service is attentive to say the least, without the bowing and scraping that some expats would expect. The food, although not cheap, is fresh (usually from the hotel garden) and the variety is wide. Both pools are squeaky clean & fastidiously serviced - though it would be nice if guests would use the shower beforehand. The rabbits are an added bonus, but here parents should accept responsibility for their children's actions and supervise them properly all the time. In response to Debbie G's comments, I fail to see why should staff be made accountable for the lack of parental supervision! Judie2011 wrote a review Oct 2012\n",
      "40 Nice place shame about the rabbits We were recommended the birds and bees resort by friends who are currently living in Bangkok. The Ocean views villas were great, the rooms were clean with huge beds, great for families. The children's pool facilities were really impressive and the kids just loved it. The kids also loved the rabbits, which are free to roam around the resort. I hope by now the resort has, as promised, to have erected a sign warning all with kids, that these rabbits can bite!  My son, who was nearly for was not aggressive with the rabbits, in fact all he did was place his hand on the rabbits neck, bend down to say hello and the rabbit leapt up and bit him on the face. The bite left two cuts on his cheek, one just under his eye! This resulted in two trips to a clinic and one trip to hospital for the treatment of rabies, which we are still receiving treatment for. The most traumatising being injections into the actual bite site, in which he needed three nurses to hold him down.  We feel that the resort was sympathetic on a very basic level. The resort did not contact us once to see how we were or how my son was after the incident, it was up to ourselves to explain the situation to them and explain to them what had happened. The assistant manager explained to us that the rabbits are know to scratch the kids if handled roughly. This was not the case in our situation. As we are not the liturgous type we feel as though the resort was let off fairly lghtly( a child died whilst we were holidaying in Bangkok from rabies due to being bitten by a rabbit).  We also feel that the restaurant staff were fairly unfriendly and unhelpful. One of the staff saw what had happened and did not offer to ring the manager or even help me with my other child whilst I tended to my son.  Although being marred by the whole incident we did managed to stay on and enjoy our time in the resort. Debbie G wrote a review Aug 2012\n",
      "30 Such a beautiful place we went just for food but sorry for the service manner We were there as a group, our secretary made a reservation for lunch of 30 people, at the end some could not make it so only around 20 could go. On the way to the place the secretary got a phone call from the restaurant asking will us be there in a way considered impolite for us sounds like they didn't really care about customer and after all they still charged us for 30 people and we asked if we could pack some food (because those people were tied with other activity and late for this lunch), they not allow!!! i never ever see any place like this before that not allow the pack the food that we already paid!(they charged us for 30 people understandable but food already prepared why not let us pack?)

      "40 Beautiful and worth another visit We spent the 2012 Songkran Festival (Thai New Year) at the Birds & Bees Resort and had a fantastic time. We were there for 4 nights (two families - 4 adults & 3 children) and were blown away by the resort. The location is simply sensational and you would never know you're only 150km from Bangkok and just south of Pattaya's madness. The restaurant is the highlight, with magnificent, huge trees overhanging the wooden decks and also providing shade on the beach in the mornings. The food was very good and there was a nice combination of Thai food and some western dishes if you wanted them. Pricing was not cheap for Thai food but the quality was excellent, so you grin and bear it. We had both the Big Bird and Big Bee units and they were great! Absolutely perfect and no complaints with the rooms. A resort information folder would have been good to have though. The kids pool area was a win with the children and gets shade in the afternoon so is good. All round this resort is worth staying at. The only negatives in our opinion were a) the attitude of the restaurant staff, who could not have been less attentive and disinterested and devoid of a smile if they tried (notable exceptions were Khun Prayoon and Khun Kittaya, who were fantastic!!) and b) the amount of rubbish/litter in the water and on the beach. The resort does clear the beach area each morning but again it's probably a staff attitude that sees the rubbish prevail regularly during the day. The rubbish in the water is not the resort's fault, as it is a problem in that province/area on the whole, with local operators, fishermen and businesses simply using the sea as a dumping ground. Sad, but local attitudes will need to change if this situation is ever going to improve. Birds & Bees Resort is great and we will definitely be back!!! SashAndy wrote a review Apr 2012\n"

      "40 Beautiful resort, basic room We went for the standard room, and although quite expensive you are really paying for the resort. You wouldn't even know you were in Pattaya, it's so calm and peaceful. The food is great and although the beach wasn't amazing it was still good to relaxing and read a book and have a swim in the sea. The staff were a bit hit and miss. None were rude, but some just looked bored to be there, which was a shame as I would say this was our biggest critism of the resort. Our waiter in the even was very friendly but the breakfast staff were unimpressed whenwe asked for more coffee. I've read reviews about the breakfast not being very good, I actually thought there was a wide choice of food and drinks!  As we live in Bangkok it is the perfect gettaway and I'm sure we'll visit again.    Tip: The taxi charge from the hotel is ridiculously high - I would pre-book a taxi before hand!

      "50 Super stay! Their suite rooms are just too good. The bathroom has a jacuzzi with bath foam in it. It was great fun. One full afternoon we were in the bath room jacuzzi drinking beer and whiskey.    The pool was good. There was another open to sky bigger jacuzzi near the pool with a comfortable sitting capacity of 4 people (even 6-7 can fit in there).    They've named their restaurant as 'Cabbages and Condoms'. They also have condoms under the glass of each table top. Its really funny but nothing cheap about the resort.The food was yummy.    We spent most nights at the walking street and Days in the pool. There is an easy access to the beach just walking down a few steps from the restaurant area.    The service was good. The hotel provides free internet access, just ask for the coupons. You can practically work using the internet from most corners of the resort.    The house keeping people will be in time to clean your room always. Simply loved that, never had to call anyone to clean my room, they'll always be in time everyday. Tiger_on_the_move wrote a review Feb 2012\n",

      "50 Completely unique Beautiful setting above the (average for Thailand) beach amongst/built around huge trees, lots of green, pet rabbits and some kittens. Lots of families. Thai food at the restaurant was excellent (didn't try other menu items). At night/ sunset the place is magical. The rooms were nothing to write home about, but didn't really spend much time in them. Fantastic to learn more about the work of Meechai, and to experience a great example of sustainable tourism. Just to be clear, there are condoms everywhere (condom flowers, condom art, condom Father Christmas). Might be a problem if you don't have a sense of humour/are an awkward adolescent on holiday with your parent. Ruth W wrote a review Dec 2011\n",
      "40 Seriously Sustainable This hotel is fantastic especially if you are into everything green. It is owned by the Condom King, Meechai who is credited with building the awareness of condom use in Thailand in the 80s and 90s. The place is a veritable paradise for sustainability from the organic farm to the solar panels on the roof.    The location is good too! The rooms are old but comfortable. The staff are very helpful. The famous restaurant Cabbages and Condoms provides a good breakfast and then delicious Thai and western food throughout the day.    The swimming pools, rain forrest walk, rabbits and the beach make this one of the best family resorts in Pattaya. pes911 wrote a review Nov 2011\n",

It is self contained and offers a family pool area and a main pool area.  There is a main Hotel wing and bungalows, all rooms are superbly fitted.

The rooms are nice with attached bathroom and a balcony facing the sea and swimming pool    They have a beach next to the resort.    The swimming pool and Jacuzzi is near the beah at about 60feets from the sea level and the view from swimming pool is amazing    The restaurant is next to beach and offers wide variet of food.

      "40 Poor service and poor english for the high price! We stayed for 2 nights in a fantastic 2 bedrooms/lounge facing the sea. From the moment we checked in we had a very lukewarm welcome verging on cold.The master bathroom was huge and the kids ( 2 and 4-year old) thoroughly enjoyed showering in the jacuzzi tub with dual shower heads. The room was fitted with flat screen TV and the beds were the biggest I've seen. Now what was missing from the room was an information folder: there was nothing in the room to describe the resort (I'd expect there'd be a lot to say) i.e. what's they were about, what to do in the resort or in the vicinity, restaurant opening hours etc. I was particularly keen to find out if like in many hotels you would get complimentary water but the only room service prices were for the alcohol and some other foods in thai.  Our first meal at the restaurant was one not to repeat. I expected a lot more from a resort supposedly child friendly. The waiters were extremely slow and not keen to help. In many restaurants I've been to, as soon as they see children they come with high chairs and plastic crockery for children (paper and pencils were too much to be expected here). Here you have to keep on asking. The food was very slow to arrive and just average. With young children I need efficient staff and not doodling ones.  I don't know what happen to the thai smile and service but we certainly haven't seen it in Birds and Bees. And forget about the thai liking children, no one came to play with ours (not that it's a requirement) but it'd have nice for them to keep them busy for min while we finished our meals.  So in a nutshell we'll come back to resort because the facilities and location are great but don't expect outstanding service. hobbsling wrote a review Oct 2010\n",

We had a lovely post flight relaxing 3 days here. Go for a 3rd floor room near the pool if you can't afford the beach side suites. Book a table at the Crow's Nest in the restaurant one night around sunset and enjoy great food with a great, breezy view. It's a 10 minute scooter/taxi journey into town and I'd recommend renting a scooter for your time there if you've got the skills to ride. For the money this is an excellent place to stay as a couple or family with kids for a few days. A hidden gem in a town full of them! Yokohama Geezer wrote a review Jul 2010\n"

      "40 Great Hideaway We visited the hotel for a long weekend. Well run hotel in lovely grounds ... good pool and excellent shaded beach. The main pool was excellent, and younger kids will enjoy the smaller pool.  We stayed in one of the family rooms, which are spacious but a little basic. We enjoyed the Cabbages & Condoms resturant ... although disappointed with breakfast, which again was a little basic.  The rooms are not great value in comparison to other hotels in Pattaya, but this is a non profit organisation that funds development projects ... so, the trade off is worthwhile.  My conclusion is that Birds & Bees is well worth a visit for a few days. Pattaya has a racy reputation, so a good choice if you have a family. Spend some time on the beach ... it is samall, but one of the best we have seen. SJBangkok wrote a review Dec 2009\n",
      "50 Like visiting the garden of Eden I wanted a romantic getaway and this place was perfect. Booked directly with the hotel. They gave me a deluxe seaview room, upstairs in villa #7, with a king size bed - for only B2925/night. This place is quality throughout. I read a news piece on site which said the owner got a $1M grant from the Gates Foundation for his work with population control. My guess is that he invested it in the buildings and grounds of this resort.    The bed was comfortable, not too hard. The shower was large with a big overhead nozzle. Bathroom is spacious. You can see birds and bees in the trees right outside the windows. There is a balcony. I was able to get WI-FI in the room one night, but never thereafter. Need to take your laptop to poolside or the restaurant to get a descent signal. Actually, I needed to find a hotel in Koh Samui and book a flight. The girl at the front desk allowed me to use their computer in the business center for free for several hours - since it was after 6pm. Very thoughtful, and I gave her a nice tip of course.    The food was wonderful. Full breakfast buffet every morning with omelettes to order. Had lunch and dinner there as well - good food at reasonable prices. I loved the signs. Walking over the bridges, the sign read \"feed our greedy politicians.\" They were referring to the many fish in the river that go into a feeding frenzy when you toss fish food into the water. They provide the food occasionally in a container mounted on the railing of the bridge. Every night you can enjoy watching the many rabbits romping around the immaculate lawn. We also walked around in their organic vegetable garden. Finally, a place that recognizes the health benefits of organic farming.    We used the infinity pool a couple times, since our room was right next to it. We also walked down to the beach and rented a jet ski for 40 minutes for B1000. Took that sucker all the way to Naklua north of Pattaya and then all the way south to Jomtien Beach, just past Pattaya Park. It's interesting to see the area from the water. Also, walked up the stairs into the Asia Pattaya Hotel next door. Huge place with a big lobby, but concrete building painted an ugly green color. They have a golf course on their property, but bring your own balls and tees, otherwise... On the street outside the hotel, we found a bar with a pool table and dart board upstairs. You can play free as long as you order a drink. Plenty of tuk-tuk drivers available. We needed to go to U-Tapao airport for our flight to Samui and negotiated them down from B800 to B500. Into Pattaya was B100, I believe. Same on the way back.    I have stayed in many hotels in Pattaya and Jomtien over the years and this one is the best. Peace and quiet, romantic atmosphere and a 5 minute ride to Walking Street when you are ready to party. Can't beat it. Bill S wrote a review Jul 2009\n",

      "40 Truly Memorable I had no intention of setting foot anywhere near Pattaya because of its unsavory reputation but a last-minute recommendation for a beach locale near Bangkok took me to this resort.    I'm glad I took the advice of a friend who has been here before.    The resort is at least a 10 minute taxi ride and across a small mountain from the debauchery of the infamous portions of Pattaya and at this place you would never know you were near the city.    The resort is quiet, tastefully spread amongst beautiful and manicured gardens and rainforest trails and I must have been there during the low season because there few other guests there.    There is not much outside the hotel grounds but there is not much reason to leave the resort.    The restaurant's menu is adequate and reasonably priced but not memorable however the seaside tree house ambiance is indeed memorable - it's like a storybook.    As mentioned in previous reviews the beach is small and far from perfect but at least it is private. I lounged by the main pool most of the time anyway.    There is a cafe or two within walking distance of the hotel but for anything else a taxi ride is required.    As surmised by the restaurant's name, the proprietors advocate family planning and that's a noble cause but having untold numbers of condoms stuck in your face at every turn got quite old. I didn't go there to support their social goals.    And, many of the condoms they had under the glass table tops were dirty and broken. That was not only unappetizing; it sent a message about their commitment to quality: are the condoms they distribute to the poor in similar condition?    Having said that the restaurant was beautiful and we enjoyed long breakfasts with a nice buffet as well as memorable evening dinners with soft lighting, great service and the sound of ocean waves lapping against the beach below.    This resort is very romantic for couples, is also nice for those who have children and except for the occasional middle aged homosexual with his rented boy by the pool you wouldn't know you were in Pattaya.    The only [small] quality complaint I have is the lack of hot water. Like many hotels in Thailand it was not hot at all. mi21 wrote a review Feb 2009\n",
      "40 Nice place The resort is beautifully designed, and profits go to a good cause. It's a great place for young kids with the rainforest pool, bunnies on the lawn, and small places for them to play. For the adults it's ok for about two days. There is no beach so to speak, and pool is nice but crowded. Restaurant is good. However, make sure to have made reservations for decks 2,3,4, & 5 that overlook the water. Otherwise, you will be seated inside with no view. sarah z wrote a review Feb 2009\n"

      "50 Best place near Bangkok for families with young children I have lived in Thailand for 7 years and am always looking for places to go with my 4 year old and 2 year old children. This is for sure the best place we've found. We stayed in one of the family suites that has a private gate that opens directly onto the kiddy pool. The great thing about the pool is that it has two very large shallow areas, so shallow that my two year old could stand on the bottom. The slides, fountains and coloured balls also kept the pool interesting for a lot longer than your typical baby pool, which in most hotels is a concrete circle with nothing other than the water to keep tots interested. The gardens are also a big plus. My kids loved throwing coins in the wishing wells and looking for trolls under the bridges that are in the gardens. The rabbits and chickens that roam about the gardens also provide a lot of fun. They also had a big santa in the restaurant that was decorated enitrely with condoms -the balloon santa as we called it! The beach is narrow but ok. It has plenty sunbeds and it seemed reasonably clean. Previously we stayed at the Dusit when we went to Pattaya, but this is definitely better. BlueCloud74 wrote a review Jul 2008\n",

      "50 Love cabbages I'm reluctant to share this place, as having stayed there two years ago, and then again this year, it was so much busier and we no longer had the fab infinity pool to ourselves!    This is a gorgeous resort though. The staff are fantastic, the rooms are lovely and spacious - especially the bungalows with the outdoor shower, the bunnies are a cute touch, the restaurant is very good, including the breakfast - there is western and thai breakfast food and I honestly cannot find a thing to complain about.    There are plenty of \"baht buses\" outside the resort which can take you into Pattaya itself if its action you are after and we never found it a problem to get into town or back again what time of day or night it was.    Its also very family friendly, with lovely family \"villas\" round the children's pool.    The beach is not too bad - and there is a nice little selection of bars and cafes down there too.    Pattaya may not be everyone's cup of tea but if you want somewhere near Bangkok airport (approx 1 and a half hours by taxi) then this is a lovely place to stay.

      "50 Beautiful, magical place !! My family ( 2 adults and 2 kids aged 3 and 4) visited the Birds and Bees Resort in December 2007. I would have to rate this resort as being one of my all time favorite places in the world to go to for rest, relaxation and getting away from it all. The reason is that this resort is stunningly beautiful and has so many touches that make it fun for the whole family.    The resort is situated on a cliff overlooking Hu Gwang Bay. The main part of the resort consisting of the main buildings, lawn area, infinity pool and restaurant all overlook the crystal blue sea and the view takes your breath away. There are always sailing boats in the background to give a picture postcard view. Add to the beautiful trees, pool, lawns and unique architecture and its hard to imagine a more idyllic place (Check out the pictures on the website and here to see what I mean).    The resort is small but this makes it cosy and intimate, a far cry from the several hundred room mass market resorts. Despite being small it has all the amenities of a big resort. There are 2 pools - one an infinity pool overlooking the sea and another specially designed kids pool in the forest complete with 3 slides and a rainfall area. The kids pool is great fun for the family. So is the beautiful infinity pool for that matter. The resort also has a nice jacuzzi placed next to the infinity pool overlooking the sea, which my kids loved. Fantastic!!    The restaurant is huge and serves tasty food. Its a 3-deck restaurant built on the cliff and overlooks the beach. Its actually build around some magnificent trees on the cliff. If you want a great view of the sea and beach and surrounding areas you can dine on the upper-most deck. If you want to be closer to the beach you can dine on the lower deck. There is a great atmosphere at the restaurant as you right on the shoreline. Don't miss the sunset from the restaurant between 6 - 7pm (see picture). The price is fairly inexpensive as well.    The beach is nice. It is not the best beach in the world as Pattaya beaches don't rank among the worlds best. The sand is perhaps a little too coarse and a little too dark. For Pattaya beaches the Birds and Bees beach is already one of the best and is still a very fun beach. The resort keeps it clean and the water is fairly clear and turquiose in colour. It is definitely a swimmable beach. The resort has a beach bar manned by several staff, who will set up a beach chair and umbrella as well as bring you towels the moment they see you. You can order drinks from the beach bar. Fantastic service.    The staff at the resort are extremely friendly and helpful. There is always a smile and a greeting from everyone.    We stayed in one of the Standard Rooms, which is the most basic they have. These rooms are situated in the Jungle area. These rooms are very basic but at $2500 baht a night is great value for money. If you are willing to pay more the resort has more luxurious rooms for you to book, many with a seaview.    Overall this resort is a real gem and I personally cannot wait to get back to this piece of heaven on earth. rabbitloverHk wrote a review Feb 2008\n",
      "40 Birds and Bees, Cabbages and Condoms. This hotel was recommended to us by the concierge at the Holiday Inn, Bangkok. I tried to find this place on tripadvisor, but there was no such listing for it. This place is also sometimes referred to by it's main restaurant name, which is Cabbages and Condoms. Condoms because the owner owns a condom company.    The hotel is located away from the main Pattaya district, but it's only a 10min taxi ride. Walking to Pattaya isn't advised because of the hills you have to climb, plus, the 'tok-toks' are cheap [-]! The hotel also has it's very own 'private' beach, a lovely pool and also a kiddie pool.    The hotel isn't ONE main building, but it's lots of smaller units, scattered around. Each unit has about 4-6 rooms, so make sure you ask for units 7-8, cause they have the best views of the pool and beach. The main pool is very nice and it looks like it's connected to the beach. The place also has a few rabbits roaming around, which is kinda cute. There are also many \"funny\" quotes posted randomly around the place.    The room we had was spacious and it had everything you needed...A/C, fan, TV, Fridge, safe and a balcony. However, what really impressed me was the size of the bathroom, very spacious and the walk in shower was massive, you could easily shower with 3-4 normal adults or maybe 5-6 locals!    The restaurant, Cabbages and Condoms, is centrally located and it has a view of the beach. Actually, every table has a view of the beach, since there are no walls. The food was ok and we declared it safe to eat, since it didn't give us the 'runs' the next day. Breakfast was 'western' style, so that was good. However, don't drink the water, as that's still not safe. Water was provided in the rooms, along with a kettle.    The location is the only main concern, as it's away from the mess of what 'downtown' Pattaya is. This could be an advantage if you want to get away from that. However, getting a taxi to BKK airport was a minor challenge, cause it was located away from the center. The hotel wanted to fleece us with an outrageous price, but lucky there was a travel agent on the main road, which provided us with an airport transfer for less than half of what the hotel wanted to charge us.    Overall, nice place if you want to relax and do nothing in Pattaya, as it has a nice pool and a 'private' beach. But a little distant from the 'action' of Pattaya.

However they have a real security problem. items went missing from our room and when we reported it to the police they told us they had lots of reports about this hotel and that the management just don't care. There are so many better hotels in the area. Happiness715888 wrote a review Jan 2020\n",
      "30 Would not return to Pattaya We visited Pattaya after a very stressful start to our holiday then a lovely relaxing week in Koh Samui. We had never been to Pattaya and heard mixed things about it, as Nova Express had great reviews we were looking forward to our visit. When we arrived we were greeted very nicely and been told we had been upgraded as the rooms we booked were all taken, this was a nice gesture.  When we got up to our floor we noticed straight away it was a smoking floor as we could smell stale cigarette smoke but we didn’t let it bother us.  The room they had given us was very nice, clean and modern.  When we went up to the pool there were only 2 sun-beds which nobody used as one had a huge hole in the middle and the other had seen better day, there were only 3 towels available to use which were tatty and full of holes, quite shocking consider how good the standard of the room was.  We ran into an issue with our flight leaving Pattaya as Vietjet air (NEVER USE THIS AIRLINE) cancelled our flight and re-booked the next day without telling us. I started to panic as we had no hotel for the next night and was going to lose the funds in Vietnam for our next hotel visit.  I asked the gentleman behind the desk to help us call them as it was in Thai, he took the phone and waited, as we were waiting an Indian family came wanting help, rather than the lady behind the desk helping them our gentleman left us and went to serve them, this was not the 1st time we had been walked away from to assist other ethnics instead so we felt a bit unappreciated. When the call centre answered we had to ask him to help us, he came back spoke with them quickly and hung up saying that our flight was rebooked and nothing they could do. My partner asked if he had asked if we could have a flight from Bangkok instead and he said “yes they not have”. I do speak basic conversational Thai and know that he did not ask anything about Bangkok.  He then said we would have to call them back and press English option.  After an hour and half on hold I had to go back and beg for more help. He did help but he didn’t seem as though he wanted to, my partner had to take over in the end has it caused my anxiety to go through the roof.  The hotel rooms are nice, pool facilities/pool deck need massive improvement, staff friendly to you but will prioritise other ethnics 1st, lady behind reception a bit useless as she didn’t seem to be able to cope with any demands made from guests.  Defiantly wouldn’t go back to Pattaya. Hannah B wrote a review Jan 2020\n",

      "30 Very good hotel I stayed there for the first time but I have booked Nova express for my friend alot of times. The hotel is good. Location is also good. The free shuttle service is an add-on. The staff is also very good except for 1 female who lectured me for forgetting my key in the room on Saturday night. She told me that there are 143 rooms and if everyone forgets their keys, her staff will be engaged inopening the doors all the time. She said this in a very stern voice and that was very rude to me. I use to sit in the lobby and she was the same with others too, she wanted to charge me 20baht for opening the door. I mean I'm in Thailand to spend money and 20 baht is just 1% of my room cost. I can just pay that. But it's not reasonable to talk to the guest like this. I strongly feel that she talks to all Indians in the same tone. Except that the stay was very good.

      "20 far from nowhere The hotel is far from anything so it's not recommended for sightseeing .  20minutes  to 2 and my room wasn't ready. Asked for 1 queen bed got 2 singles. The safe didn't work so to change batteries they needed 3 people and 30 minutes. The pool is small with very limited sitting area, mostly used by smokers so I sat in the smoke as only 2 out of 14 people were sunbathing. People went to pool without shower first and played their music on the phones. The room looked new but table lamp didnt work, no slippers, no toothbrush. No hot water, towel smelled after single use. The hotel shuttele is 2 per hour although i was told 1 per hour. no info about shuttle service in the room. Staff are rude especially the house keeping. Outside the hotel looks like war zone with hundreds stray dogs. At night there are prostitutes waiting. The guests were loud at night making it impossible to sleep. The hotel has potential but the clientele isn't the high end.  the mini bar price list shows coke was complimentary at 60Baht. so what is it, free or 60BAHT!!  There were cockroaches in the room. even the dead ones were not cleaned up by the cleaning staff.    I went to swim at 7,30am. but no towels were available. the pool opened at 6am. signs said no room towels allowed on the roof top. tonyhalik wrote a review Dec 2018\n",
      "10 Skip The place is for one not close to any attraction or getting to a central place to make your move from there. The staff are very very average and are absolutely not in the mood to help. The worst was the incident of some drunk customer banging and kicking our room door at way past 0200 hrs in the morning with the reception absolutely not aware nor the security.

      "50 Fabulous Hotel Whenever I’m passing through Pattaya, I always make my way to the Nova Express. It’s conveniently located to be close to all the entertainment, malls and restaurants. Yet far enough away to be quiet at night.  The rooms are modern, clean and comfortable and offer great views of Pattaya on higher floors.  The staff and security are fabulous, always friendly and courteous.  Finally, the rates are consistently very affordable. PhilipFB wrote a review Oct 2018\n",
      "50 Close to beach, amazing roads and great night life The hotel is just amazing. Its quite close to beach and the roads are amazing. Night life is good. Shops are near by.

Malls like Big C, medical shops, fruit vendors, local cuisine, public transport. This saves time to travel at your favorite spot. Rooms are clean with good interiors. Staff is friendly. Its a budget hotel with good standards. Kreena B wrote a review Aug 2018\n",

      "40 I wanto to give 5 star but... I've been here other times but this time it was so so....  The location is not the best, even if there is a shuttle that takes you to the Central every 30 minutes (it is often late but for me it is not a problem). The hotel is invaded by Indians or Arabs often sitting with their feet on the sofas of the lobby. The room is comfortable and even the bathroom is ok but a little more attention could be used in cleaning the room, the towels are old often torn and rough, too bad, the first day I found the remains of chips beside the bed. The bed is very comfortable, the air conditioning works very well and is silent motion. Just advice a little more attention in cleaning the room and especially the towels, this is the reason why my judgment is very good Anyway, for 2 or 3 nights is good. I'll be back.

A beautiful pool in the roof complete the offer and a restaurant is ready to serve if needed, but i can't express myself about the quality as i never been there.  This time the hotel was full booked and i cannot stay more of the five days already reserved and i had to change. Staff top professional.  I can recommend this property , maybe the only weak point the location is not the top and better to have an own bike or car for better move from hotel to beaches or center city.

      "40 Clean and modern Nicely presented Hotel, good facilities and pleasant staff. The beds are slightly more comfortable than most, pillows are wonderful. We took a corner room to gain a little more space. The room was nicely decorated and well appointed. There was no power outlet for the coffee/tea facilities or anywhere along the workbench/desk area,but we looked at a standard room and it didn't suffer from this issue. My only real complaint, and it did cause difficulties, was the refusal to issue an additional room key to the second guest, this is just stupidity and needs to be rectified.

There is basement parking, a fairly fast and friendly checkin, rooms which are a good size, comfortable bed, great and easy to use aircon, lovely bathroom and TV with some English programmes.  The breakfast had loads of fresh fruit and veg, as well as the more tradional stodge, and best of all, when I went down this morning on my second day and asked for a cup of green tea, the charming and very friendly man whom I asked had already put it at my place while I'd been getting my food together. He'd remembered from the day before. Excellent. Strogly recommended JamesAmaze wrote a review Feb 2018\n",

Rooms are spacious, clean, Amazing Wi-Fi, Range of TV channels, Nice pool at the rooftop, Gym, Variety of things in Morning buffet. Free shuttle to walking Street, beach road etc, 7-11 is just next to it and near to Big C Mall. Only Draw back is Its away from main market, Walking Street, beach road etc though they have free shuttle but still it took so much time every day to go there. Giving 4 due to its distant from main street otherwise overall good hotel. vikram_narang wrote a review Jan 2018\n",

      "20 Could of been perfect This hotel has the potential to be a brilliant with a beautiful roof top swimming pool and room to compliment it if we didnt have to move rooms. Twice. After only our first night staying here we woke up to cockroaches on the bed and the floor. We instantly complained and were moved to a room on the 8th floor quickly. We didnt recieve any apology from the staff members. The day after this we returned to the room to find that it hadnt been cleaned even tho we werent in the room for several hours. Later this evening our air conditioning stopped working. We then proceeded to spend the next hour in this hot room wiles the repair man attempted to fix the air conditioning. Unfortunately he couldnt so again we had to move rooms and again recieved no apology. Although this is this second we moved in 3 days. On our last night here we found a massive cockroach in our new room which made my girlfriend feel uncomftable.    The good thing about the hotels are the roof top area. Its fantastic. The rooms are nicely designed with out cockroaches and dodgy air conditioning. The location is fantastic only a 25 minute walk from the main strip and beach. We could of really enjoyed our stay here its just a shame to of been let down more then once. Jason C wrote a review Nov 2017\n",
      "10 Not worth. Should have chosen any other in beach road. Prefer baywalk I checked in to room 312 and it was stinking very bad and when I complained they sprayed the washroom drains but it dint go then also. After some time I complained again and was moved to room 821. As you can see from the pics the room was filled will flying Insects and we realised that only after opening our luggage second time. When I complained the lady at desk she was so arrogant and asked scoldingly if I want to change room or not as if she is paying me to stay or I’m staying for free. Instead being apologetic she was rude. At last changed third room at 12:30 am and was ok. Suggest to choose any other hotel instead like bay walk where I used to stay earlier. Nova says they are 3-4 star but I say it’s zero. Don’t go with pics they provide in various sites and cost... of you are staying for 2-3 days go for any hotel in beach road as it’s more convenient.

The way to metro station is bit far for walking every day but if you use taxi it's not bad located. Breakfast is same at every morning. İ have not seen new combinations.

However the blue mood lighting in the room and the black, gold and chrome fit out throughout wasn’t for us. I guess it’s meant for Pattaya clientele. We should have asked for a non-smoking room as ours smelled like old socks or worse. Value for money without a doubt but not what we would have chosen. Need to walk to the street corner for a cab as they don’t phone for them at reception. Cath H wrote a review Nov 2017\n",

      "40 Nice Hotel and Good Value Pros:  Clean modern rooms, albeit on the small side  Big, spacious bathroom that always has hot water  Nice big screen TV that works properly  Ample counter space in the room to place belongings  The room has a small fridge and kettle with coffee/tea  A/C works very well  Solid and reliable WIFI signal  Beautiful rooftop infinity pool and a small but usable gym  Cleaning staff are very friendly and dependable  The hotel shuttle runs every half hour and drops you at nearby malls and the beach    The cons of the hotel pertain to the surrounding area. To the immediate right of the hotel is a bit of a rundown area with tons of stray dogs walking about.  The room I had was to the back of the hotel, every morning without fail I was awakened by a rooster and singing birds, I was never able to sleep past 6:00 AM. Alwehsh wrote a review Nov 2017\n",

Hotel is a bit of out of the way, about 15 min walk to beach and 8 mins to main street, not the best part of town and the surrounding streets are quite filthy but I didnt feel unsafe walking around at night. Only concern was the cleaning of the room was not up to standard - my dirty coffee cups were left there, the bed headboard was not cleaned with grease stains from a previous guest. My bedsheets were not changed even though they obviously were needed to be. Breakfast was very pricey at £11 so I didnt opt for that.

      "30 Great until deposit return. As the title suggests I had no problems with this booking. The rooms are very clean and nicely appointed. The staff were always polite and attentive. Which made my departure that much more surprising. ...    When checking out I presented my room card and told them I was checking out. They happily complied and when about their business. It seemed to take a bit so I sat down in a nearby chair.    I should have prefaced this with a small explaination. Each customer must place 1000 baht deposit. I assumed the delay was waiting for the room to be checked so I could get my deposit back.    I soon realized that the room had been checked and that the return of my deposit wasn't actively being pursued. Then I remembered they issued a receipt. So I dip into my bag and retrieved the receipt in its original envelop make my way to the counter and hand them the envelop to get my deposit back.    After several minutes of coming and going to a back room I'm met by one of the desk ladies and informed my deposit we released to \"my friend with a different room number\". Then showed me a name and room number that was not mine.    I was travelling alone and didn't know anyone else.    Several more minutes go by .. more coming and going into the back office. I again take a seat because of the time being taken.    At about the 40-45 minute mark I finally I lose my patience and make my way back to the counter and demand my deposit back. At this point they tell the receipt I handed them was in someone else's name and had the wrong room number on it. Apparently this is why they thought my deposit was given to someone else.    At this point I'm beginning to suspect a scam but honestly a mistake like that can happen.    I ahould also point out that they immediately take your receipt fold it up and put in into an envelop without present it to you can lead to these mistakes. I never opened the envelop - I simply handing the envelop back to them.    So I tell them just that .. handed to me in an envelop .. never looked at it. Now where's my deposit?    More trips to the back room. I now suspect they are trying to run me out of time with all the trips to the back room.    Then the desk manager comes back out and informs me they have no funds to return my deposit. Knowing this is complete BS I demand my deposit back. Again off he goes to the backroom and minutes elapse.    Finally he emerges with my deposit. Then he explains that since my deposit is not on file there the young lady that issued my receipt will have to pay for it.    This is of course is nonsense..each person who books a room leaves a deposit and gets a piece of paper. At the end the piece of paper is handing back and a deposit is returned. Nobody gets a double deposit back because two receipts get issued.    They still had my deposit. I suspect someone was trying to swindle my deposit from me, then, after trying to wait it out of me, try guilting it out of me.    That is absolutely despicable behavior.    So I take my deposit as I will not be swindled, lulled, or guilted out of my deposit.    So, if anyone else has a similar issue with this desk crew please report on this forum.    It is possible this was an innocent mistake and the desk manager desperately needs a tune-up on how to fix small mistakes without infuriating customers or punishing employees.    But there is also the possibly that false receipts can be easily handed to people in sealed envelops hoping they simply give up trying to get their deposit back or simply forget about the deposit altogether.    And when that happens who do you think pockets the deposit???    This desk crew needs to be watched more closely. Again, if you have any similar issues please post them.    Cheers. 639warrenc wrote a review Jan 2017\n",
      "40 Nicest Thai cleaning ladie ever Good hotel for value.  Breakfast not for me , but then I don't wake up for breakfast  The staff in this hotel are great always pleasant and helpful  Only downside for me is the elevator is temperamental and a little frustrating.  But all in all I'll be going back in may. Good location.  I stayed room 711.  But the cleaning ladie arunmar who cleaned my room daily was the nicest ladie ever. Credit to nova. If she come room early and I asleep. Guaranteed she have my room cleaned even after I leave room after 4 pm. Staff in hotel 10/10 cathy m wrote a review Jan 2017\n",
      "50 Excellent. Stayed for 9 nights. Hotel was perfect in every way apart from location ( which wasnt really a problem to be fair, a 2 min walk to bhat bus route or motorbike taxi).    Exceptionally clean, staff very helpful and pleasant. Upon check in i had no local currency and forgot to alert bank i was traveling abroad so had no means to pay unless in GBP. The reception team seen o problem here and held the GBP equvilant in deposit until i had means to pay, nice touch.    Not that you want to stay in your room and watch tv when in Pattaya but large flatscreens had hundreds of channels in all languages and room service was available from a 3rd party.    Its so cheap now due to been a new opening so defo worth a booking now before they realise they are charging too little! Andrew C wrote a review Jan 2017\n",
      "40 Very nice and friendly staff The staff was super friendly, helpful and very efficient. Place was very clean.  Swimming pool very clean and nice. Good breakfast.    Hotel was too far from the town center (Shopping mall). Pick up from hotel BUT no pick up from shopping mall.    No restaurant in the hotel except for restaurant.

      "40 Lovely rooftop pool Had a nice 2 night stay here, room was comfortable with a nice big bed and very adequate air con. Bathroom was nicely designed with rain fall shower, however the only downside was that the drain had clogged up and pretty much flooded the floor every time we used the shower. The highlight of the hotel is the rooftop pool, it is lovely! Would stay again! mattymaitland11 wrote a review Jan 2017\n",

      "50 Great Value High Quality Hotel This seems like a relatively new hotel tucked away in a side street from the corner of Pattaya Central and Third Road. This is a great location with lots of places within easy walking distance - like the Big C shopping complex.    The hotel is modern and fitted out to a pretty high standard although the decor is bit garish (particularly the bathrooms) and might not be to everyone’s taste. The rooms are very spacious and represent exceptional value for money. There’s a large flat screen TV, minibar, complimentary water, tea and coffee and free wifi.    There is a small pool on the roof with sun loungers and towel service. There’s also a small gym but there is no bar in the hotel and no room service is offered. The restaurant is only open for breakfast and then closed for the rest of the day.    We didn’t book our room with breakfast included but we paid to try it on the first day. Breakfast is charged at 250 THB per person (just over £5) and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. Although the selection isn’t huge it was all of a fairly high standard and included an egg station, various Asian dishes, cereals, fresh fruit, salad, bread and pastries, cold meats, cheese and some sushi. The last time I was in Thailand we stayed in the Royal Cliff Beach Resort and the breakfast at Nova Express easily surpassed the quality that was provided there. The service too was excellent and puts the miserable lot at the Royal Cliff to shame. The coffee is excellent bean to cup too not the stewed filter coffee the Royal Cliff were serving.    It was nearly 11pm when we arrived at the hotel and they couldn’t find our booking on the system. This has the potential to be extremely frustrating after approximately 20 hours of travelling. Surprisingly though, the lady on reception just took a photocopy of my passport and gave us a room saying that she would sort it out with the manager in the morning. I travel a fair bit and problems at check in with missing reservations etc are not that uncommon and it’s not something I would hold against any hotel. What is important though is how they deal with issues and Supaporn handled the situation really well and I couldn’t ask for more than she provided.    If you are looking for an extremely well priced hotel in a good location and you can live without a bar and room service then this hotel is really, really good value. I would have absolutely no hesitation in staying here again and I’m sure I probably will. Stuart H wrote a review Jan 2017\n"

      "50 EXCELLENT STAY.GREAT HOTEL.HELPFUL PERSONNEL The hotel is located just 20 minutes from Pattaya beach.The room was big enough, modern furnished and with a great view. On the 8th floor, you can find a supreme swimming pool, with clean towels and a breathtaking view of Pattaya city. Generally i had a great stay and i recommend it 100% to everyone.

      "50 5 STAR HOTEL @ 2-STAR PRICE Wonderful hotel in many regards...but perhaps most exemplified by the staff! Very efficient, helpful, and English-fluent. Of particular note is Narttaya at the front desk...one of the nicest, sweetest, and sincerely helpful people I've met in SE Asia. The hotel was better than anticipated, so I extended my stay several times. Comfortable bed, all the amenities you'd expect (and more), and just 5 minutes to the beach by motorbike, Definitely recommend! ASEAN4EVER wrote a review Dec 2016\n",

Rooms were adequate for the money paid and breakfast was also very good.

This hotel has a roof top swimming pool (to my surprise!). goochongkiat wrote a review Oct 2016\n",

Location some what compromising as it is a little far from the beach road and goes not have any scenec view outside as the place is surrounded by open barren land and few small houses. The rooms are also small but pretty cosy and comfortable. They also provide free shuttle service to the beach. Overall pleasent experience. Jawhar B wrote a review Oct 2016\n",
      "50 Very good price and quiet location. The checkin was at 2pm but arriving at 8.30am from Bangkok by taxi; we were told by Ann - Molrvethai at the reception that we may have to pay for such an early checkin.  We agreed to wait till 12 noon but she was so kind and good to get us that we settled in by 10.30am at no extra cost on the 17th floor which we requested and the 2 rooms on the same floor too.  As well, she is smart and got us a taxi (Griang Taxi driver - 0821766325) at only 800 bahts for the whole day to Nong Nooch Gardens & on the way to see the Khao Chi Chan mountain with a massive Buddha carved on it.  We were unable to use this booking due to rain but there were no charges or problem in cancelling it in the morning at 7.30am for 9am departure.  This flexibility and understanding really endured us to Thailand and it's people.  No crosswords or anger at the need to alter plans.  The rooms were spacious since we had an upgrade when booking with mosaic collection.com who got us the best rates than the one we had booked at another website in this same hotel for the same dates.  The bathroom was big with a walk in shower- no bathtub which did not bother us. Though it had only half a bath screen water never came outside it.  The shampoo and bathgel are fixed to the wall.  So is the soap dispenser near the sink. It is a new hotel and has mirrors everywhere and very well equipped rooms ( TV, coffe-tea making, safe, mini bar, hairdryer)though no toiletries are supplied except for shower cap and cotton buds. For the price we paid it was very good indeed.  The restaurant is compact but no queues and there is an egg counter where one can order omelettes/fried eggs etc. Breakfast was very good and plentiful though for Europeans the choice maybe limited.  The Chinese tours come and go all over Thailand so it is difficult to avoid them at any hotel.  Nova Express being a small hotel did not have too much of this big contingency arriving all the time like we saw in other hotels. This hotel is just off the main Pattaya road in the old town.  The staff in the restaurant are so attentive and obliging and bring your egg order to the table and clear the tables immediately.  All in all this hotel is excellent value for money.  The Big C supermarket is just a 5 mins walk across and 7 eleven store is so useful and is around the corner from the hotel.  The other reception staff gave us an extremely reasonably priced restaurant( Monae Seafood ); which is so clean and lovely food just closeby on the left side on the main road.  The other reception staff have no clue or ideas for taxi bookings nor are they well informed.  Finally I had to go online and booked a lovely obliging lady driver called Angie (0865758437 ) who drove us all over for the day for 1000 bahts.  The reception staff change regularly and could not/ would not find out about Ann's recommended taxi driver.  When Ann got back on duty on the last day of our stay, she saw the taxi card lying at the reception which the other staff could not find.  But Angie was such a flexible person that I highly recommend her taxi service and her English is good.  Ann also kindly printed out our travel bookings for Bangkok and made no charges.

      "40 Good new hotel The hotel recently just open around late Q1' 2016 so they are brand new and cannot really find any trouble. However, we think staffs could do a bit better. Upon arrival our first impression was one staff was chewing gums which is fine for us but a bit strange for a hotel staff. We experienced some bad smell from toilet drainage but not by much, also the aircondition controller make beep noise during its operation auto-altering speed of fan, which is quite strange. If the location is okay for you, this property is a steal for under 30usd per night. techtwo wrote a review Aug 2016\n",

It included a fridge with mini bar, a water boiler (I made soup for breakfast) and free Nescafe. It has a great pool and lounge. The only downside is it's a bit removed from the action. Most taxi guys didn't know where it was even with showing them a map and address. It's in an area under gentrification so the surrounding blocks are under developed. Perfectly safe to walk though...

      "40 Excellent Hotel for my Test, and Go Experience! Booked for the Thailand Test and Go entry. Compared to other choices in Pattaya available when I booked Nov. 2021 this was inexpensive. Airport pick up was a bit frazzled - no fault of the hotel. It's like a commodities trading floor with all the hotels in one corralled area trying to find their pick-ups. I don't recall how I found my way to the Sunshine Hip driver. Trip to hotel was on time and well done. Upon arrival tested right away and then off to bed. For an arrival at 3am I was concerned about when I would be tested and if my booking was for the night I arrived or the next night. I emailed the hotel many times and finally while in transit received an email that stated my arrival constituted an early check in. Turns out that arrival night was all I needed - test came back 5 hours later and I moved on to my condo.    The hotel provided a meal upon arrival and a breakfast. Neither of them were good and fortunately came with fruit. The staff was very friendly and very responsive. My luggage was carried up to my room. Room was clean, seemed well maintained and spacious with a large comfortable bed. I also appreciate the abundant and convenient power outlets (next to and in the headboard of the bed).    Everything was as advertised. The location is quite good - 3 min walk to convenience store and a shopping mall. As Pattaya comes back alive this would be a good choice for traveler wanting to be in the center of the greater Pattaya entertainment area. Smile0507 wrote a review Dec 2021\n",
      "40 AQ Quarantine Hotel - Good Value Lovely people and a good deal for airport pickup, PCR test, one night and breakfast AQ bundle (just over US$100). Room was relatively spacious and the bath was a really nice size. All the staff were very pleasant and kind. Also a good location in downtown Pattaya. Only thing that stops this being five stars is that the bedsheets had some small brown stains which were a little off putting. Ben C wrote a review Nov 2021\n",
      "40 Very good SHA+ hotel Great room for a 1 night SHA+ stay. Room was comfortable, staff was friendly,pickup from airport on time, covid test upon arrival, english breakfast. Arrived late (2 AM), but had covid test result back by 12:30 PM in time for checkout. Would stay here again. Jet820143 wrote a review Nov 2021\n",
      "30 Ok Mid Level Hotel The current big money maker is being a quarantine hotel. This place provides all the services cheaper than most other packages you will find however all hotel are definitely overpriced. The place is clean but it's just a small average hotel. The staff is nice. The bed and bedding is comfortable. I think the regular rate is a little higher than it should be but the fairly close location to the beach tends to make it higher. chtown2017 wrote a review Nov 2021\n",
      "40 Sha+ hotel This was a nice comfortable hotel at a reasonable price. I booked in this hotel because it was a sha+ hotel and I had to quarantine for one night. Everything was as stated.    The only problem was in the wording of the conditions. It was a sha+ hotel and I got a rt-pcr test.    However when I submitted my forms for the thai pass my application was rejected because it was advertised as a SWABs test.    The reservation team need to alter the advertisement to say rt-pcr test or other people might get the same rejection.    Other than that single problem the hotel is value for money.

      "10 最悪&絶対に予約してはいけません ここは絶対に選んではいけません。  タイランドパスのために予約と同時に決済されましたがその後の対応が最悪です。    必要資料の1MB程度の添付がサーバで弾かれ、案内されていたlineで添付しても資料はメールのみOKと言われ、その後無視で放置プレー。    添付が弾かれることやどこでどのようにピックアップされるのかの質問も全て無視。当日いきなり確認書だけ送られてきて、どこで何時にピックアップするかも無視。    当日空港について全てのホテルが5分以内に速やかに送迎された後も40分以上待たされ、連絡してやっと適当にピックアップ。    確認書がなかったためタイランドパスは最初のメール文章の添付で拒絶されましたが最後直前の確認書でギリギリアプループ&チェックイン。    とにかくサービス業の体をなしていないトンデモホテルです。    They never reply after sending their template email for the process for COE/Thailand Pass.    Their email server doesn’t accept attachments over 1MB, don’t accept their line messages, ignore to send their confirmation letter for Thailand pass, never reply to any questions including how they can pick me up at the airport.    Even at the airport, every AQ hotel at the airport picked their customers up within 5 minutes while sunshine hip hotels didn’t come over 40 minutes.    I STRONGLY SUGGEST not to chose this hotel as Thailand pass. Yosakoisoran wrote a review Nov 2021\n",
      "10 1nightquarantine room clean and ok but no balcony and tv remote not working. Paid 5000 bath in deposit for 7 day quarantine at 17000 bath. Only got 900 bath refund because since I only had to stay 1 day. So I paid 4100 bath for trip from airport plus mandatory pcr test.    BUT CHEAP CHARLIE MANAGEMENT TOLD ME I WOULD HAVE TO PAY 500 bath EXTRA if I wanted lunch and dinner even though they had sent me a mail saying full meal course was included.    Arriving at 9 AM Nov. 1 that attitude pissed me off so much that I preferred to stay hungry and checked out the same evening as soon as I got my test result.    Also - the reception was seldom available by phone and they could not figure out how to provide me with a username and password for wi-fi.    Can't recommend. But they do smile a lot.

There was underground parking at the front of the hotel with 24 hour security. Check in was good. Lobby was clean and inviting. Rooms were perfect size. They were clean and freshly renovated. Hotel is minutes away from the beach and the new mall. Location is great. We used the rooftop pool which was just big enough for a refreshing dip. Checkout could be a little quicker, but no big deal.

      "10 DO NOT STAY HERE I had terrible experience with this hotel.  The first thing was that they will make you pay again on arrival.  Even I made a payment through booking.com, they said it takes 7 days for the money to be transferred from booking.com to the hotel.  So the customer needs to take that risk just in case of that they don't get the money from booking.com.  And there is another deposit aside from that.  But I had to pay, if not you can't stay.  The room wasn't clean, I found someone's hair on the bed and towels.  The room isn't soundproofing. You can hear every single thing from the corridor. Every time other people open their door.  Also 8am in the next morning, housekeepers were laughing and being loud in front of my room and I was waiting for them to be quiet. And they did that for 30 mins so I went out and told them to be quiet.  They just looked at me and didn't apologize.  And the best part is this.  The doublepayment I made on arrival, they said it will take 7 days to be returned.  I didn't get the money back on that day, so I called them to follow up.  Then suddenly, they said it would be returned within 14 days.  Guess what!! It's already 3 weeks now and NO MONEY BACK. Jiminlee wrote a review Mar 2019\n",
      "50 For the price , this is my new go-to place in Pattaya! In the Pattaya North area, this hotel is just like any other ones in the area, but with lower price and much cleaner environment. Location is very close to Central Marina and the beach while the staffs are friendly (most of time...); and most importantly, with the price, this hotel is very clean (try other $30USD hotel in the area and you will appreciate the cleanness here).

It has smoking and non-smoking option and everything is considered reasonably with great price. Various type of foods for breakfast, powerful elevators and AC system, nice staff and very fast WiFi. They keep 1000 BAHT as deposit before check in which is ok. Room spaces are designed quite smart and everything works well as they are all new. The location is fine also and we didn't hear annoying noises. I suggest it for anyone who rather stay in cheap but great hotel. ash6218 wrote a review Feb 2018\n",
      "50 Lost Paradise !!! Pattaya a good beach and romantic getaways for solo and couple travellers. We travelled in group of 6 persons in Jan 2018 for a short trip and stayed in this hotel. The hotel is located centrally and is 2 min walking distance from Beach and 10 mins drive to Walking Street. The hotel is equipped with all basic and luxury amenities, has a good breakfast spread and service is also good. I stayed in Premium Room on 8th Floor.    Basic thing about Pattaya has changed a lot in past 1 year as compared to my earlier visit,.... There are lot of bars and pubs where people are not allowed generally and asked to pay entry fee of 100 - 150 USD !!! (Sugarbaby, Baccara, Happy A GO GO, etc) Even The local people in some street side shops and malls don't want to sell their products and ask a high price for the products so as to discourage the customers from buying... The prices are even higher then the nearby Mike Shopping Mall... I inquired about a Hand Purse in the Mall which was about 2200 THB and the same thing on the road side shop was 2000 THB with no bargain !!!    In my opnion the charm of the place has been lost and better not to visit this place. The local people also endulge in street fighting with the foreigners and police do not accept any complaint about these locals. There are many other safe destinations to visit, but certainly not this one ! amitsha_9 wrote a review Feb 2018\n",

The check in is horrible, very slow and the guest are not welcoming.. after a long drive from bangkok you expect to have a great service from assisting your luggage to the room or atleast escort you to the room but it never happens.. the entrance before the lobby is very dark and most of the time there is no security there late night.. the front desk can't even greet you with a smile! One time we asked the front office guy about the nearest night market but unfortunately his english is not well.. From the check out is still very slow!

      "10 Not recommended for place like pattaya Sunshine Hip hotel Pattaya, looks nice in photograph in there website, and TripAdvisor but reality was something different than actually you expect in Pattaya like place.  The positive Aspects of the property.  Location is good you can drive both way to reach different places in Pattaya, near to Mall and attractions in Pattaya, pool is good place to hang out, they mentioned in there review also for pool bar which was not seen any day we stay, that's even not my concern as I get everything from near family Mart or 7 eleven or big c near by.  Hotel is very new, on our last day of stay only they celebrate one year completion ceremony. Elevator was good.  Now the negative aspects, the hospitality of the staff is awefull, they always so very unhappy and rudh with guests.  The front receptionist was tried to blame for missing of my room key which was submitted to her while we are out and asked for the housekeeping and when do we come and asked for keys she denied that she was took my room keys when am asking for a CCTV footage of the time I left hotel she gave me a another key, it's the tricks they are playing without becoz they will charge extra money as they kept deposit of 500bhatt initially during cheek in, same thing happen to me with pool towels very bad kind of things happen and lastly they charged me for broken of complementary water bottle when they found nothing to charge which was actually I dumped it in a restaurant while having dinner if they told me I will carry it along after having dinner that's completely wired thing in my life that someone can charged for complementary bottles.. God are you people reused it again...???  And I will share a chart of damage things charge list... Seriously are you in holiday, we are not that dull that we are spoiling the hotel property... Wired..  Bad drainage at there best category room..  Next is the breakfast... It was heartbreaking for us nothing is there, the breads are so stale so old, and some days there is no buffet breakfast too...  My only thanks for the hotel to give me a early cheek in for my room.

They use a glass shower wall instead of curtians. The wall is not seal to the tub so water leaks to the floor. No matter how I tried to shower water always ran on the bathroom floor. They did have a drain so most of it drained but there was always some water on the floor. Could cause you to slip and fall at night if not care ful.    I start to request pool towels every morning and would put it next to the floor against the tub so catch the water and stop the floor from being wet.    I did not get breakfast since they are all the same buffet and after a few days of the same selection you get tried of it. Like2traveloverseas wrote a review Oct 2016\n",

      "50 Good value for Money Well, required quite some walking into the soi in order to reach this hotel, but never mind that for I drove. This will not be your typical open them windows and enjoy the sea breeze, nor the walk over onto white sand beach type of hotel. But rather a very economical worthwhile stay in rather trendy well furbished room. Large bathtubs some have, so ask for a room with one. There is a roof top pool that offered that soak to beat the heat in the afternoon. However, it was unattended, good being you can have the whole pool to yourself. Bad being, with no life guards, no one will save you if a strong gust of wind blows you over the sides and onto painful death below. Expect some thumbing bass late onto the night from the surrounding entertainment, this is staying in Pattaya where all the action is after all. It was a good stay for me during a business trip and absolutely worth it. KingsLCL wrote a review Sep 2016\n"

      "30 Clean and modern. But no rain spa shower I got this Hotel of Agoda with a very good recommendation and choose it for the rain spa shower which was displayed on the pictures. Unfortunately, I received a room with another shower than displayed. Which made me very sag. I got an bathtub which tends to over float when you just shower. I don’t know why so many hotels have this poor kind of construction in the shower. Just put a door or something. I had my room without breakfast, so cannot say anything about that. The rooms are well equipped and clean. Very modern furniture and wall art. Which would make me give 5 Stars. Unfortunate I got disappointed from the shower. As well the construction noise from the lower level. All they did was to give you a note underneath the door about “we will do construction, sorry for noise and inconvenience” Sleeping during the day was just impossible. So 3/5 Stars. But that just made the last bit of my trip sad time. Martin M wrote a review Sep 2016\n",

      "10 Just because its new , does not mean its good ! I stayed there in the new building for 2 months , Had to change rooms 4 times , first time the all night bus lot next door kept us awake & the smell was bad from the bus engines, next on pool side the sewer overflowed into the bathroom from the shower drain , Moved again , this happened all over again, staff was trying to help but they where overloaded with all the problems, Finally we left end of second month & spent next 4 months in Chiang Mai. I do not recommend Baan Pattaya Plus ! kklowe123 wrote a review Feb 2016\n",
      "40 Excellent hotel, apartment, condo complex. Great value in a very good location in North Pattaya. 3 walking blocks to the ocean and beach. Excellent shopping, nightlife and entertainment abound. You are a short Tuk-tuk ride to virtually anywhere in Pattaya, Jomtien, Chonburi for 10 baht. Close attractions are Art in Paradise, Differ night-club, Big C Central shopping. Tango54 wrote a review Dec 2015\n"

      "50 Great one Hey, you may go there and enjoy yourself with your family. You can also go with your girlfriend, it is really a good place to go and spend some times with her. You and she just had a great time. I went with my family and they love it very much. Their services are simply awesome. Mizan R wrote a review Aug 2019\n",
      "40 Stayed here for our Honeymoon We stayed at this hotel for our honeymoon and was a bit disappointed about the honeymoon-suit accommodation at Long Beach pavilion as it was just as a regular room and located in the far back (villa 2)...    Except for that we were very pleased with this hotel, it is quiet, clean and the staff is very friendly and helpful! It is a 10 min taxi ride to downtown Pattaya. There’s a couple of restaurants close to the hotel, but we recommend to go a little further to get more choices and good Thai food.    Btw, The staff should inform guests that it’s ok to use the Long Beach hotel down the road, we learned this the last couple of days..! Freya L wrote a review Aug 2018\n",
      "50 Best villas in the vicinity - ideal for family with small kids We had been on a vacation and wanted to stay at a silent serene place. Last couple of times we had stayed in Amari and A-One Royal cruise and had great experience but they were quite noisy in the night due to the proximity to walking street. This villas was perfect for us so that we can have our baby sleep well and we relax in the pool in front of our villa. SoumyaM wrote a review Jan 2017\n",
      "50 Very good place We stayed in Luxury Villas but you can use a whole complex of Long Beach Garden Hotel &Spa with distance 3-5 minutes by walk located directly on the beach .Such stay I recommend because the Villas are at nice calm place , modern , space full , good equipped. You can go for breakfast at Luxury Villas area or go to hotel. Staff and service very good, a lot of restaurants, every where cleanness. Friendly for families as well . Karel L wrote a review Jan 2017\n",
      "50 Nice Good hotel and worth money. Staff was ok but not active but no problem. you can ask hotel staff to drive you to the beach or 5 min. Walk . The room is so big and clean. I was stay at 1st floor WIFI is ok. Restaurant was great. Good taste good view value price. patsako wrote a review Aug 2016\n",
      "50 Long beach pavilion Awesome stay in long beach pavilion.  The hotel was very quied day time and night time. The employees are so friendly and common, very patient to helping you for everything.  Nice pool, nice restaurant, nice room.... All was clean and the staf very professionnal.  Spécial thanks therefore to my friend Moddam, and specialy to madame Jitmanee and miss Sukkeaw🙏👍😄. Great job! alee thai wrote a review Mar 2016\n"

      "10 Horror! This was the worst hotel (hotel?) I have been in my life!  No light in the stairs, you enter by a door that looks like the hell`s door, it is in a different location than shown in the map, the room was dirty, full of ants, and I couldn`t have a bath because there was no way of making functioning the bathroom!  Completely crazy.  And the couple that received me, a pair of french drunken oldies, was completely weird....  So... what is this place? Ezequiel C wrote a review Dec 2016\n",
      "40 If you don't mind Sunee Plaza, this is a good deal This is on the quieter side of Sunee Plaza, but a bit of a stretch to say its quiet as some have done- you can still hear the loud music from the bars on the other side of the plaza well enough at night. You have to enter by a side door at night, and go up narrow stairs, which only light up once you have reached the next landing. The gay bar scene may be a put-off for some.  Spacious clean room. Owner pleasant to deal with. Good free wifi in room. Chris M wrote a review Apr 2016\n"

      "40 OK for a night or two We picked this hotel for proximity to a health centre I was visiting and it turned out to be an OK choice. I think this is more of a residence than a hotel as we seemed to be the only paying guests. The rooms were clean and spacious and the staff friendly.    Breakfast was included and as 'the only internet guests' a table was set just for us and breakfast was a basic, but adequate choice of eggs, sausage and toast with tea, coffee and juice.    If I was in the area for the same reason i would stay agin but its not the most convenient for restaurants, bars and the more lively parts of Pattaya. TomOrr wrote a review May 2018\n",
      "10 Not happy at all Rooms are not very clean: spyderwebs in the toilets. Wifi was terrible. Breakfast subpar. Stuff was quite unfriendly. Noise isolation is not existant, could not get a proper sleep. For this value expected much better. Anton K wrote a review Feb 2016\n",
      "40 Good Value I found Pattaya to be pretty expensive but this hotel was good value cost about 1000 baht a night stayed for 3 nights during the water fight festival. the hotel was about a 10 min walk to walking street which was where most of the action was.    The room was very big with a big bed which was very comfy air con was a lil slow but worked fine.  the bathroom was decent wit a big walk in shower which had a lil mold in some places but wasn't bad at all,    I found the hotel grounds to be nice and staff was friendly,The pool was decent maybe could do with some more sun lounges.    The only disappointment i thought was the breakfast but considering the price i have no complaints about this hotel. Jamie J wrote a review May 2014\n",

      "30 March 2009 This is a really nice standard hotel, the staff are lovely and helpfull. The problem is the location,although its only a 10/15 from walking street it is difficult to find, especially after a few beers, took me about 5 nights to nail the soi (its 16 or 17) that takes you from the walking street area to the hotel. Also there are very few bars near the hotel. The hotel is good value for money, but i will go back to a more central location next time i visit. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review May 2009\n",
      "40 pretty good hotel it takes about 20min. getting near by the place to play. there`s a bike for 40BAT nearby the hotel so use them for go out playing. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Apr 2009\n",
      "30 Eurasia Hotel is good room but room amenity in agoda web write room have bath tub but no have, room rate quite expensive but room only should incl breakfast is better and quite far from main street. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Mar 2009\n",
      "40 Eurasia The eurasia is a rather new hotel so it is assumed that there is going to be a few kinks. however I enjoyed my stay very cheap, good service, but little out of the way i would deffinatley go back though.

      "30 A Surprise with the Shower The hotel is nice and the staff is friendly. Now the horror story: I have my girlfriend get electrocuted in the shower. For some reason there was electricity in the water one night. She came out of it running like a bat out of hell. It was scary. We found out that in the room next door, the girl in the shower got shocked and felt unconscious. She ended at the hospital.    To our luck, it was our last day there. The staff gave us (and the couple next door) a free breakfast. WOW! you would have expected them to give us at least our stay free. The moral of the story, be careful of the electric water heaters wherever you go. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Feb 2009\n",

I have just returned from Thailand, Pattaya and after staying at the Eurasia Residence hotel i cannot heap upon it the praise it deserves.These residence were just excellent in every way,from the time i arrived to the time i left.  I Was impress with the service, and the staff could not do enough for me.The only short fall was the breakfast menu it did not change the whole time I stayed there. Other than that I would recommend it to every one who would like a quite and pleasant place to stay.  Regards R.A.Robertson sgtrock wrote a review Oct 2008\n",

      "40 Clean and cosy place, good price I stayed 2 times in Citra Suite. One short time stay as a hotel guest and one long stay on a monthly rental. Both times I found the place cosy and clean and really worth the money. The staff was helpfull enough. The location is still central, you walk almost everywhere but it is totally quiet and you can enjoy a good night sleep, I will come again. AlexanderBoris666 wrote a review Jul 2016\n",
      "10 Avoid this hotel There are 2 buildings in the property, \"Chitra Villa\" and \"Chitra Suite\". Chitra Villa is dim and outdated whilst Chitra Suite is new. The management separates each hotel (building) in different pages on online agent websites.    I called the hotel in advance to make sure which hotel is which before I decided to book (and pay) Chitra Suite. I arrived at the hotel late night. Staff took me to the building behind which is of course the old Chitra Villa building even I insisted I booked Chitra Suite. The room was unacceptable, definitely not the one shown online.    I refused to take the room and called my online agent. They called the hotel, but to no avail because night shift staff spoke no English. Even I am Thai, negotiation still took around 2 hours and I decided to call police. (If you don't speak Thai, don't even risk to stay here.) Finally, hotel staff allowed me to stay in the room I booked before police came. Banglumpoo wrote a review Apr 2016\n"

      "50 Good Hotel and great services The Hotel is extremely well located, not far from the walking street (5 min walk) and in a quiet street. there so many interesting places as restaurant (Turkish, breakfast, Thai), markets, and more. The rooms are very clean with an excellent Wi-Fi connection. But the main strength of this hotel is the service provided by employees as the 24 hours reception with a keep key service and they are so helpful and nice with the guests. If I go back to Pattaya (hopefully) I will return for sure. taky wrote a review May 2017\n",
      "40 Good Location & Amazing Staff's We checked in Holidays Home on 14/7/16 for 2 nights stayed.  The location of this hotel is good.  It located near markets,massage shops,  restaurants,7-11,shopping mall,food stalls,  and \"Pattaya Walking Street\".  The hotel provides great WIFI,flat TV,  good shower,modern&clean room and  comfortable nice bed(value for money).  The staff's are amazing,always smile,  friendly and ready to help you.  The best thing about this hotel is you have access to use the swimming pool & gym  at their sister hotel(Mind Resort),which  about 5-10 minutes walk.  This is the second time we stayed at this hotel and will stay again for 3rd visit.    *Only Negative - No Elevator*  **Highly Recommended** clvnlaw wrote a review Oct 2016\n",
      "40 Good hotel We stayed in this hotel just one night. It's location is good, not too near the beach but walkable. There are many markets, shopping malls near by. The room was neat which colorful decorated. Staffs were friendly. Unreasonable price for extra person charging. Tuyên T wrote a review Jun 2016\n"

      "40 Lovely hotel, but choose room wisely. Booked for 4 nights, however, on the first night we were facing west, and down below, 17 floors- was a nightly music festival, going on to 2am. It was so loud we thought we were inside a vibrating drum. The hotel knew about this, but still put us on that side, when there were empty rooms on the east side. I complained and we were moved. All OK then. Dave K wrote a review Jan 2020\n",

The staff were great and very helpful and friendly. The room was a great size and very clean and tidy. Breakfast had a great selection and we would highly recommend it for the price. We will be back one day. Nicholas S wrote a review Dec 2019\n",
      "50 Great Hotel, great staff and good location Finally found a hotel in Pattaya with decent, polite front of house staff. For the past few years I have been staying in 2 other hotels within the same chain and one in particular has had an ongoing problem with rude and impolite front of house staff, however this hotel was staffed by wonderful people from the reception desk, the dining room the concierge, the bell hop and the domestic staff, nothing was too much trouble.  The breakfast was enjoyable with a good variety of Asian and Western food including an omelette bar which actually went beyond just omelettes.  The location was good for me, not too far from restaurants and bars, I will definitely be staying there in the future and passing the good news on to whomever will listen! allstate66 wrote a review Nov 2019\n",

Hotel on 3rd road across road from soi Lengkee which lead into lk metro area.    I had good night sleep here. Only tip is i would check in befor 5pm as after that you will get bus loads off chinese checking in which causes delays. Mattsta wrote a review Sep 2019\n",
      "40 Large hotel in the center of the city This is the flagship of the LK group, a large (25 story) hotel just off the 3rd road, at the end of the LK Metro entertainment area. This is an impressive structure and I had one of the best rooms, a one bedroom apartment on the 23rd floor. The hotel is done in a faux oriental version of the \"Empire luxury\" and so were my quarters with silver/gold colored ornamentation. All in all, my room was certainly well equipped with separate living quarters, a small kitchenette, spacious bedroom, and an impressive bathroom. I was not impressed with the service, the reception desk was slow and not very helpful. When I was there, a large contingent of Chinese tourists on a group tour stayed in the hotel, with all typical problems. My main complain is that I could not get to the breakfast restaurant and when I finally got there I had to compete with the Chinese to get any food. On the second day I skipped the breakfast entirely. I know Pattaya well and I know how to move around but for those unfamiliar with the city be aware that the main tourist attraction - the Beach Road area is a good (or perhaps bad) walk away; you may have to walk through somewhat sleazy areas. Josif D wrote a review Aug 2019\n",
      "50 5 star luxury hotel where you love like a king We love this hotel. Me and my brother stay in the kings room with a kitchen, living room and two separate bedrooms. The views over the city are great, the breakfast is very nice and the beds are really comfy. You can control all the lights, tv, even the panel on your front door that lets staff know if you want to be left alone or room cleaned from a little box next to the bed. They stock your fridge up with special LK President bottles of water every day and the staff are great. The only down side is the WiFi can be temperamental in your room but this is Thailand. In reception it’s fine though. There’s a decent gym and sauna and steam room as well. Would 100% recommend.    You’re one road away from Soi Buakhow which has loads of bars, restaurants and pool halls and also has LK metro on it which is a great place to drink. Then walking street & soi 6/7 is bout a 5 minute bike away. If you’re staying in Pattaya this is the hotel for you and very reasonably priced for what you get.    It’s always cheaper to book through booking.com. We didn’t know this when we first came through the door but the guy on reception told us to do that rather than book through him which I thought was a nice touch. Danny wrote a review Jul 2019\n",
      "30 Lower Budget with Very Substandard WiFi This hotel is not bad for the price but, the Wi-Fi reminds me of the days of the dial up modem. Substandard when it is working.    Rooms are comfortable and the gym is adequately equipped. Sauna and steam room included.    Breakfast is very lacking if you plan on eating healthy. Stuart G wrote a review Jul 2019\n"

I paid 1400bht per night but you do get what you pay for. Unbelievable views of Pattaya and it a very nice place to stay.

Anyway I got my friend a suite on the 25th floor...two balconies, kitchenette etc.  Fantastic view...  The price 18000.- is fair for this what I would call a appartment...  Will be back!

      "40 A bit pricey but nice Splendid view of the city from the balcony and from the gym that was located on the 19th floor. To bad the pool was on the ground floor and all the jaccuzzi jets were not working.  A great big breakfast buffet with many thai and falang options. Safety box and refrigirator in the room, nice big bathroom/shower.  Being 4star it is a bit pricy of course but not bad if you want to treat yourself, a negative is that it is on the \"wrong\" side of third road, it can be a pain to cross to get towards the city.

Breakfast buffet is extensive with many local and international dishes and included in the room price.    All in all, the hotel is very recommendable.

      "40 A comfortable basic hotel Imagine a hotel which has room sizes of a 5 star and a basic service of a ibis business hotel. Being in Pattaya, this is what is required as most of the time is spent the night and around the beach area.  For a vegetarian to find 3 different things to eat, other than bread and fruits is seriously a huge positive.  The rooms are spacious and bright, though sound proofing could be a little better.

Didn't replace tea or coffee set on 4 occasions. Dirty shower curtain.In room safe failed Good size room but dat,ed. No balcony. Staff mainly indifferent and while reception friendly very poor English. When booking in not shown to lifts let alone room or told where restaurant located. Breakfast is a joke. No Western food other than eggs, usually cold, and Asian food indifferent. Much better value to be had elsewhere. One last thing. Room booked for two but only two pillows. I asked for two more but was told I could have one but would need to pay extra for a 4th!!!!!  I've travelled the world and never had that before. nick b wrote a review Feb 2019\n",
      "50 Excellent stay and friendly staff We had an excellent stay here. Hotel had nice location with super rooms with nice view. We stayed at 23 floor. Breakfast was excellent and special mention to friendly staff. One person of our group had to cancel the trip and Fon at reception was very helpful in cancelling the room for us, even though our bookings were non cancellable. A big thanks to her.  Will stay at this hotel again when in Pattaya. sushilsinghee wrote a review Feb 2019\n",

      "30 Could do better There is no doubting that aesthetically this is probably the most luxurious hotel in Pattaya however there are a few things that let the hotel down. The noise levels are completely unacceptable, meaning sleeping is off the agenda and the staff are rude and unhelpful! emrengeo wrote a review Jan 2019\n",
      "10 Terrible Dirty and worn hotel on third road, far away from action. Cleaners very lazy and therefore not nice to sleep in a dusty and moldy room. (see pictures) Painting falls down from shower and even to 20th floor you hear LOUD Asian discomusic whole night. Impossible to sleep. :( The only star goes to girls in front desk, especially to Sophia who works like an animal. AVOID, just AVOID hoikkis wrote a review Jan 2019\n"

      "50 Central, Comfortable, Clean Hotel! Two Brits living in Malaysia. Went here for 7nts. Hotel very clean. We booked a Twin, city view room as we didnt see why we should pay extra just for a double or king bed, so when arrived we asked if beds can be together & they did that for us.  Pleasant staff, but no welcome drink & cold towels to cool like other hotels give, but wasnt bothered, but is always a nice touch when arrive.  Great view from room of city n a quiet room we got like requested. Even though hotel is central it is far enough from all the sleaze that goes on in the area & no noise from bars.  Surrounding areas of the hotel is lovely, clean & the gym is great on 19th floor with great views too.  Breakfast is nice. Cater for all Asian tastes. A toaster, Cereals which there could have be more choice & maybe Yogurt but wasnt any of that. Good omelette station, which the guy was lovely when I asked for Poached eggs which he did specially for me.  I would recommend hotel but the area is a single man's paradise. We knew what to expect & we where meeting friends but I wont be returning to this part of Thailand.  The area outside is just a very dirty open sewer & when is rains it gets flooded!. Saw Rats ,but thankfully not in Hotel. The Lady boys /Girls are just like chops in a Butcher's window waiting to be picked.  It does put you off looking for a restaurant has you get hassled all the time the minute you stop to look at a menu. There is a Subway Sarni place down road. A 7 Eleven next door.

      "50 Palatial. Highly recommended. Stayed here for 5 nights in October 2018, As soon as you walk into this hotel, it's like walking into a Palace, big chandeliers and ornate furnishings. Had a standard room on the 21st floor which was very spacious, nice soft double bed, plenty of storage space and large balcony with excellent views of Pattaya which was stunning at night. Very modern bathroom with large shower enclosure and very clean. Could not fault it at all and for the price I paid, it was a bargain !!!  I found all the staff there very helpful and friendly despite other negative reviews which you may have read, everyone from the bell boy, reception staff, dining room staff and housekeeping were generally pleasant and smiling throughout my entire stay.  Breakfast buffet was varied including Western and Thai dishes and served until 11am, they also serve omelettes and cook eggs the way you like them which is a nice touch, I found the dining room very pleasant and not busy at all, from there you can access the swimming pool which is large and very clean.  OK The negatives, there were other guests on our floor who came in at 4am on 2 occasions shouting in the hallway and making so much noise, it woke me up, the Hotel should address this kind of behaviour. Secondly the Hotel is situated on the 3rd Road in Pattaya, at the best of times this is a busy road and potentially a death trap, be careful when crossing this road as there is no safe crossing nearby. The Hotel needs to get a pedestrian crossing here or have a traffic warden at busy times.  Anyway hope this helps in your decision. Have a good holiday. Martin503 wrote a review Oct 2018\n",
      "30 Smile, people!!! That's the business you are in!!! Very good facilities - the gym, interiors @ the rooms and common areas, views - especially higher floors, etc. Good location - far from noise but easy access to key locations.    One thing I want the hotel to change, and change immediately, is how staff interact with guests. I haven't seen any of the staff is reception or the housekeeping team smile at a guest - ever, in the 6 nights I stayed in the hotel. Every time I approached these staff, I felt I'm not welcome...very irritating indeed    Bottom line, I'll not return to this hotel given numerous options Pattaya offers Chandrashekar BN wrote a review Oct 2018\n",

We were in a 2 bedroom suite on the 22nd floor & it was fantastic! The suite was spacious, clean & the view was amazing. We could hear some music from nearby clubs at night, however, with the doors closed it was fine. The buffet breakfast was great with plenty of variety. The pool was clean, but a bit small. This hotel does not have a bar or restaurant (apart from breakfast) but there are plenty of great places to eat very close. Overall a great stay. Jacqueline S wrote a review Sep 2018\n",

Overall hotel is very clean and tidy but front desk staff are not very friendly and attentive towards guests coming in and out. Breakfast has lots of options but more for Chinese and Koreans. More western options would be great.  Hotel is little away from the 2nd road and beach road but taxis available easily and good walk in the evening when the weather is pleasant.

Balcony with good views over the city.Decent sized pool that was never overcrowded and a great buffet breakfast in the morning. The staff we're always polite and helpful and provided me with any information I needed. My only slight complaint would be my room on the 18th floor was situated next to what seemed to be a store room and early every morning I had a young lady sat outside using a walkie talkie not really a problem for me as I am usually up and about very early but it could easily disturb anyone that likes to have a lie in in the morning. Wpykd not hesitate to book this hotel again should I return to Pattaya. scowy68 wrote a review Jun 2018\n"

Take a room at a high level for a great view. The only let down is the sun at the swimming pool because it goes behind the building all day. The hotel drops the Chinese, Indians and muslims on the lower floor, so they don't disturb the regular farangs on the higher floors. Very good and highly appreciated to keep them seperated as they come in hordes and shout and behave unrespectful to Thai people and farangs.

      "40 The view from the 26 th floor is interesting The best thing I can say about this hotel is that it is still fairly new and as such, most parts of the building are better than at the other local LK hotels.  My room is on the 26th floor and that helps keep the noise level down. Crossing Third road by foot or vehicle still offers a real challenge. the restaurant serves a good variety of food for breakfast, but is not available after 11:00 AM. Locally, they recommend use of the DoorTo Door delivery service which contracts with local restaurants to bring food to you at other times.  My room is cleaned very well and the staff is very accompd@ting if you have special requests. There is ample parking but be careful in the early evening when the buses arrive and plug the driveway.  Overall I would give this hotel a little better than average rating and would probably return at some time in the future.  Internet in the room is excellent sanget wrote a review Jan 2018\n",

      "50 It pays to look I traditionally stay at another hotel in Pattaya this time their peak season rates were nearly doubled from normal times so I searched for a more reasonable price. This hotel is an astounding bargain. The hotel is as impressive a place I have stayed even equalling or better than Las Vegas casinos I have stayed in . From reception staff to room size and cleanliness it is outstanding accomodation at any price much alone the less than $100aud I paid . Even the sheets were noticeably softer and fluffier than any hotel bed I have found . Breakfast in the dining room both Asian and European foods fresh ,hot and abundant. The other two establishments I use in Pattaya have lost my business. This will be my hotel from now on. Highest praise to them. Phil E wrote a review Dec 2017\n",

      "50 Wow! Amazing hotel! I have never been in a fancy hotel and this was a first. When we walked in the lobby was the biggest and poshiest I have ever seen. When they took us to our room in the 23rd floor it was a shock how amazing the view was frombthe balcony. The room had all you could think of. Hotel gym was a basic one with everything to do some light exercise. The sauna was a bit disappointing,let me explain.  The sauna stone should have waaayy more stones in itself, because it is a risk to throw water on the bare resistors. The hotel should fix this issue immediately and add more stones so that you cannot see the resistors. It also makes the experience more enjoyable :). All in all great hotel. Maickki K wrote a review Dec 2017\n",
      "50 Clean and tidy I am a single but well seasoned traveller. This hotel is located away from the central tourist location.  The Pros: a clean and modern hotel with a nice lobby area. I opted for a one bedroom suite which for the money could not be beaten. A generous sized room with a separate kitchen/living area and two TV,s one in the bedroom as well as the living room. Both modern flat screen Samsungs. Room was cleaned daily including the washing up of dishes.  The kitchen had an electric hob and microwave and they even supplied pans, plates, glasses and utensils.  So ideal if you want to self cater.    The cons:    There is a noisy night market across the street which takes some getting used to but for a single guy it was a minor issue.    Breakfast: I opted to include this in the booking but if I'm brutally honest, if your a Brit like myself you may not appreciate it. It's overwhelmingly tailored for the Chinese. They do have a an egg and bacon cooking station but it's nothing like a proper fry up.    My advice if you want a cheap proper British fry up is to use the Retox Bar just across the road and so value for money. 99 bahts for a full English including fried bread and black pudding. They also serve lunch and dinner including stews and pub grub.  Drinks were cheaper than the numerous street bars.    Conclusion:    This is a good hotel and value for money. It's got a small swimming pool and a decent gym where you can get a decent workout as well as sauna and steam rooms.    Getting to walking street and beach road is quite a bit of a walk but you can hop on a motorcycle taxi.  I chose to hire a moped for a week for £30 from Swiss Bikes which is only 10 minutes walk from the hotel. Companion663603 wrote a review Dec 2017\n"

The hotel is easy to find, as it is one of the tallest buildings in the area.    Breakfast was good and open from 7 to 11 am. But a few dishes had a tendency to be cold after 9:30.    My room on the 19th floor - enjoyed a great view of southern half of the city, including the sea and the big Pattaya sign.    Wifi was excellent, with consistent 30+ mpbs download speeds.

The TV had about 10 speaking English channels. The breakfast buffet is the best I think in Pattaya this was well worth the extra money to buy the practice but they show if you're going to stay in Pattaya this is where you need to stay.

If you want to spend time in hotel then choose hotels like Hilton, bay view, holiday in, hard rock hotel etc which for a higher price.    Breakfast was poor for non asian crowd.

The location is away from the majority of noise in 2nd road and beach road but close enough to walk in the day time or night time...I stayed in a suite as it was in the high floors and commanded a great view of the surrounding area...it is also important to note, the LK president is a host to multiple Chinese tourist buses at a time . Also popular with Korean Tourists who wish to play golf whilst the wives go shopping with the children.... breakfast is good as long as you tell the cooks what you really want and if they don't have it they will make sure you have it , the next morning...rooms are clean and looked after daily by the floor cleaning staff..24/7 front desk and good security Alan A wrote a review May 2017\n",
      "30 Good Hotel but the location is poor and secluded I stayed there for just a night and found rate this as \"Great Value for Money\". It is new, clean and decently maintained.    We booked a 2 bedroom suite (family room) and it was on the 25th floor.    As all the LK hotels, the design is very palatial and grand. This hotel is vertically built, with i guess only 8- 10 rooms on higher floors.    Our room opened in the living room with a small open kitchenette. It had a Induction stove, water kettle, Chimney above the Stove and basic utensils. We also had a 2 door fridge suitable to stock some fruits, cooking material and make ICE.    The Living room has a sofa setup suitable to comfortably seat 4 - 5people and a centre table. The Television was just opposite this sofa so all can enjoy.    The living room opens in two identical living rooms. Both living rooms have there own full bathrooms and separate balconies. The Living room also has its own balcony.    The Bedroom had comfortable beds, cupboard, safe box, a vanity mirror, working table and an electronic time piece which connects all the lights of the room.    The internet speed was good. The staff was decent.    Breakfast of the hotel was a a very good spread, and i felt it was more towards the Chinese guests. The dinning area was big and had semi open space as well.    The swimming pool is relatively small but overall this hotel makes a good value for money.    One thing that is a problem is its location. its 15 mins from the beach road by foot. The nearest lane has a Family mart which will take about 5 minutes to walk, but then again, once you reach that street you can feel there is a diff in the vibe of the place. This hotel can be good for long stays. Parit Gupta wrote a review May 2017\n",

      "30 Beware the concert venue next door The rooms are new and excellent, the front of house staff and housekeeping very friendly and helpful. The management totally useless and without any courtesy towards their guests. Be aware that there is a concert venue with regular events next door to the hotel which will keep you awake to the early hours of the morning if you are on the wrong side of the hotel. Requesting a quiet room is ignored and the attitude is very negative when the problem arises. I even emailed the management with my complaint but didn't even have the courtesy of a reply. They hide behind the front desk staff and let them take the brunt of the complaints. Very unprofessional and unfair.  Only other points are that this hotel is heavily used by Chinese tour groups so the breakfast is decimated quite early and not replenished. Also the location on 3rd road means you have to cross a wide very busy road to go anywhere and would be a problem to the less agile amongst us. nick b wrote a review Mar 2017\n",
      "30 Great value for money Great rooms, clean and on the big size. Pool and gym located at the ground floor. Hotel is located with close access to bars, restaurants and easy access to taxis, scooters on the main road. Decent price for a nice hotel J0hn_travel wrote a review Mar 2017\n",
      "40 Really liked this place!! Nice new high rise. You know your in a nice place as you walk in the marble tile floors and 20' ceiling. Rooms all modern with complete room control center next to bed, can turn lights on/off, thermostat, all at that box. Mini bar, large dressers (need hangers in closet), mini bar, safe, flat screen with lots of channels (for different countries). We were on 23rd floor with spectacular views! King size bed and breakfast buffet in morning. Pool on north side, 1st floor  Strong smell of sewer gas in room at times, was almost nauseous and had to get air in when we left the room and air was off.    Regardless, I would stay again. After all you are in a 3rd world country! Mark D wrote a review Mar 2017\n",
      "30 Comfortable hotel Clean comfortable room, not bad location. Reception staff need customer service training as well as the reception manager who is quite rude and abrupt. Buffet breakfast needs replenishing as most things are empty. Housekeeping staff only ones at hotel willing to help. No minibar and wifi non existant. Underground parking good.

      "30 Decent Location but not great hotel Location on (very busy and dangerous) 3rd road but within walking distance of LK Metro, loads of choices for golf bars and restaurants as well as the nightlife in LK Metro and Soi Buckhau. Hotel is big and very popular with Asians - I thought they had evacuated South Korea when I arrived. Breakfast is tailored accordingly and although plentiful, English/American breakfast options are limited. Room service comes from nearby restaurant and you have to pay cash, even if they get the order totally wrong! Rooms typical LK style - old fashioned but spacious. Furniture filthy, some ants in room (21st floor!). Bathroom good, plenty of hot water and bath filled quickly. Internet so-so and sometimes not available for days. Staff generally helpful and guest friendly. AC is noisy and probably not clean (I had sore throat every morning). Better hotel options available nearby (e.g Areca Lodge) but, if you just want a bed to sleep in, this place is good if you get a deal. Jim G wrote a review Feb 2017\n",
      "50 Excellent What an excellent hotel in every detail. Nice, new, modern and clean with excellent helpful staff. Choose B&B if its an option, Breakfast is buffet style with all tastes catered for. Bedrooms are very large with one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. If on a high floor the views are spectacular. Highly recommended for couples and families in a good location away from the hustle and bustle. roomdt4 wrote a review Feb 2017\n",
      "50 Great hotel Stayed here 7 nights nice new hotel , room excellent and clean , great shower and good TV channels so you can have a night in if you want , pool cold also you can only sunbathe by pool in the mornings , breakfast just ok Mark W wrote a review Feb 2017\n",
      "40 Could almost be perfect Room:  Beautiful marble tiles and beautiful furniture however the gold finish on the majority of furniture had been chipped away and didn't look very nice. TV had lots of channels in a variety of languages.  Wifi was very poor throughout the stay and at one point an engineer had to be called to our room to fix it.  Bed was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in.  Bathroom had a huge shower that could comfortably fit 4 people in, no bath though. Did have a cockroach in the bathroom at one point which was weird as we were on 21st floor.    Pool:  Did not use the pool as it receives no sun whatsoever    Breakfast:  Went once, massive spread but didn't appear to have much there.    Staff:  Cleaning staff were excellent and very friendly and one member of staff even gave my husband a hug when we left.    Only once or twice was it noisy from outside music events but otherwise quiet.    Decent location 5/10 minute walk to Soi LK Metro. Tiidgey wrote a review Feb 2017\n",
      "40 Excellent rooms! Stayed here in one of the suites with two friends. Suite was massive; fully working kitchen, separate bathrooms for each bedroom, a comfortable dining area and relaxing lounge space with TV. Beds were also very comfortable!    Breakfast was disappointing and definitely catered to the Chinese / Asian market, with lots of food I wouldn't normally associate with breakfast e.g. sweet and sour chicken! The fruit, toast and eggs cooked to order was perfectly fine though.    As others have commented, the road outside really is extremely busy and there is no pedestrian crossing, so you do have to take a bit of a gamble, which isn't ideal. It's not like you can avoid crossing this road either, because you have to in order to get to the beach / the nightlife.    Overall, a very comfortable stay in a city I would never, ever want to return to. Going back to the hotel was a very welcome relief after seeing Pattaya and my friends and I agreed that if the hotel was not as good as it was, then we would have left the whole city a day or two earlier! luke0501 wrote a review Jan 2017\n",
      "50 Fantastic hotel and staff except one !! Stayed here for 15 nights and absolutely loved the hotel. Rooms were great and we were in the 25th floor which gave us a great view of the city.    Rooms are big and very clean. Wifi was fantastic and the gym had great kit.    The staff on the doors were absolutely fantastic as is the manager and the cleaners however the only let down is one guy on reception . He was horrible . I had a couple small requests and he was horrendous to deal with . Rude, arrogant and didn't care about the customers.    I can't mark the hotel down for one guy though . Really really great hotel.

      "30 5* Hotel, hazardous location Booked in for 2 weeks, but had no choice but to move to a different LK hotel after only two days!  This is a brand new hotel which opened in January 2016, it has everything you expect from a top LK group hotel( except for a very small pool, not family friendly)  However, the hotel is on the busiest road in Pattaya (3rd road).  You take you life in your hands every time you cross the road. Lorries, buses, cars and motorbikes are completely oblivious to pedestrians, it is extremely dangerous!  I am not scaremongering, but please do not take a family holiday here. The hotel is amazing, but crossing the 3rd road just twice a day is incredibly treacherous.  LK group have hotels nearer the beach, my advice is to book one of these.  'Stay safe in Thailand'  Lisbon lisbon555 wrote a review Jan 2017\n"

      "40 Clean, comfortable and good value We stayed here for 3 nights in a 2 bedroom suite and were impressed with the quality of the facilities. Great air conditioning system, a modern kitchenette, TVs in each room including the living room and 3 balconies. The decoration was a bit odd (kind of 1920s), but the furniture was excellent quality and the bed was super comfortable so really you couldn't ask for more in terms of the room. The breakfast, however, was a massive let down. A bizarre mixture of left over food from what looked like days ago and none of the normal European style food you would expect from a luxury hotel. Or indeed good Asian alternatives. The pool is decent, if a little small and shaded. The location is close to one of the main sex districts of Pattaya. How you feel about this depends on how you feel about Pattaya in general. I hated it and would never come back, but if you want to come here, LK President is a good choice of hotel and you feel sheltered from the nightmarish scenes below.    There is something a bit unusual about the LK President - an odd atmosphere that I can't put my finger on - but then that goes for everything in Pattaya. When we were there, it seemed deserted and yet there were lights on in most rooms, and the only other tourists, were jaded looking scatterings of Chinese guests. But for what we paid, this was a good hotel - just don't pay for the breakfast. shanghaiskies wrote a review Jan 2017\n",
      "40 Great new hotel, friendly staff... Super comfortable, friendly staff. Enjoyable stay, excellent new gym with most equipment... Only slight down side is that the swimming pool is always in the shade... Lots of Chinese guests stay here.    Breakfast is good with full range, omlette station made to order with choice of spaghetti or Chinese chicken or pork with fried rice or noodles.... Along with choice of fresh fruit or croissants. susst g wrote a review Dec 2016\n",

      "50 one of the best in Pattaya Second time here and booked again for January. Has the most comfortable bed I have ever had in any hotel, staff are really helpful and polite rooms are fantastic and the location is good 2 mim walk to soi Diana and LK metro easy access to second rd and walking street. For the price you pay is worth every penny, Breakfast is good and you can order from a menu as well as the normal buffet, You can go cheaper but for this price why?. Room cleaned daily and well equipped, is true that there are lots of Chinese here but I have no problems with different nationalities after all we are in Thailand .    Would highly recommend here and as I said I have booked to go back in January smithth wrote a review Nov 2016\n",
      "50 Staying longer This hotel is amazing. The front desk service is efficient and polite. The room is excellent. Self contained and luxuriously fitted. WiFi is free and breakfast buffet is good for Asia. Fresh omelettes pastries fruut and nice coffee for me.  Pool is tucked away but clean. In fact cleanliness is what's so impressive here.  I came for a week and am staying another.  The location is perfect. No noise problems and wow the views from the top floors.  I recommend to anyone. nigelhenson wrote a review Nov 2016\n",
      "30 Mr Andrews I stayed there for a week recently in the 2 bed apartment on the 26th floor, the apartment was great, clean, spacious, wonderful bed, if your looking for a hotel with loads of extras this probably isn't it, the pool gets no sun after midday, no room service, breakfast is awful, only had it once, coach loads of Chinese turn up every morning, weird set up, just as well there is a nice boozer/ B & B called the swan pub & grub 5 mins walk we're you can get a great breakfast for around 100 baht plus other good English and Thai food, the location is good, very central and most importantly it's guest friendly, depends on what your looking for.

      "50 Superb! 7 day stay visiting family Pattaya, if read some mix d reviews on this place so was a little worried, but these worries were soon dispelled.  Amazing entrance reception area sumptuously decorated. Checked in smoothly we arrived at around 11am but this wasn't a problem and the staff were really helpful and friendly.  Asked for a high floor room and we got put on the top floor (26th) lovely room clean and spacious with a superb view over the 3rd road as we were above the pool.    Breakfast was a strange affair with all things available from fried rice, noodles and even salad! With of course the usual cereals and breads along with eggs and omelettes, enough choice even for the fussiest of eaters.  Pool was just fine, small quiet and very relaxing does always get the sun but it's still very warm just laying out on a sun lounger.  Absolutely first class hotel we loved all aspects and wouldn't hesitate to return. Toro07 wrote a review Oct 2016\n",
      "30 Not up to expectations - hidden charges - language barrier Unfriendly receptionists, demanded 1000 baht refundable cash deposit per room in addition to the credit card charge already paid which was questionable and unexpected. Also wanted 500 baht per additional guest per day per room. Room service was unresponsive and did not seem to understand simple English, did not get us an additional shampoo / bath soap for room in spite of repeated calls to front desk.    Only saving grace was we were given higher floor rooms which were quiet and clean. Had no problems with disturbances and housekeeping was good. Price paid was very reasonable given it was also the low season and in the aftermath of the King's passing.    Breakfast was included in the rental and variety was good. Had a selection of continental and Asian fare and selection of fruit and beverages. If you are vegetarian as one in our group was, you may not find much selection. One should plan to arrive early as the food was mostly gone when we arrived on the first day after 10 am for breakfast. an0neemus wrote a review Oct 2016\n",
      "10 Please don't go! To the \"ghost\" manager Edi Siraphat,    I was looking forward to stay at the brand new LK President on my business trip in Pattaya but it’s turn out as a disaster!    When i booked online they ask me if i want it to be at high floor or not and i said yes for high ones. On my arrival to the hotel i checked if my request been took on board and i ask for a quiet room and your staff told me (smiling in the same time) “don’t worry sir you are at the last floor, nobody there!”  On the night of the 4/08 a room below me playing loud live music till after midnight! I phoned several time to the reception but nothing been done. Couldn’t sleep.  On the same night a very nasty smell was in my room and phone the reception do to something. Changing room wasn’t possible and someone came with a toilet spray and spray in my room and the bathroom!!!!! Magic!! what a night i had!  Also the night crew was rude! I asked for a couple of drinks and ask to put on my room and they said: 'cash only'. My cash was in my room and had to go back up to pay! Seriously!?  No mini bar in rooms  No room book with phone numbers, receptions, advice where to go,…no internet password connection (i had to ask), no TV program, etc….  Manager not on site  Very dispointing Breakfast,  Pool area, they were cleaning at 9.30 in the morning, use it for 2 minutes (then leave cos) with cable in it and jacuzzi not available and polishing floor around! not felt welcome there!  Concierge rude, no hello, no thanks you and very annoyed when i asked for a town map! He was sat on the sofa and didn’t want to be here and wasn’t happy when he had to stand up to gave me that map! (that map that wasn’t on the front display(was empty) it was in box behind the concierge counter! well organise!    Nothing been done by your staff or manager on duty, (no manager, it was your day off, so no manager!) no appologies, no help…. Wow!  Also your staff (Jalyne and Bua) suppose to pass the message to you to call back! Nothing! Miky C wrote a review Aug 2016\n"

      "50 Outstanding Absolute luxury for an amazing price, within walking distance of central Pattaya you're only a minutes walk to Soi Lengkee & Soi Bukahow.    The rooms are outstanding, super fast wifi, city view and the greatest credit to the hotel has to be the bell boys in blue they're the friendliest people I've yet to meet in Pattaya the grumpy staff behind the desk should take note.    The only drawback is they've put the pool in a ridclious place for catching any sun and it's a bit of a nightmare for crossing the road. If you're not good on your feet I'd reccomeded somewhere else.

      "40 Impressive New LK hotel Stayed here for 12 nights from 11th April..  Beautiful rooms, beautiful foyer, friendly staff, good housekeeping..  Did pay for breakfast but to be fair I wouldn't take it again..  You won't find a good English breakfast here, only an egg station and toast, pastries n fruit.. Asians are well taken care of with choice aplenty..  Our rooms wifi was hit and miss some days but the TV had plenty of sport and movie channels to view.. The bed was very comfy indeed with beautiful linen..  The gym was not ready to use and the hotel pool is nothing more than a plunge pool for the hotel size..  Some people will not like the busy road you need to cross during the day..  All in all this will be a lovely hotel when finished.. With the soft opening prices on offer right now this was a bargain place to stay so I advice people to stay now before the prices double or even triple..  Overall a very enjoyable stay..

      "40 Will be brilliant when it is finished The hotel is effectively brand new and it shows;  While not to everyone's taste, the gaudy décor is quite impressive, the room was spacious, comfortable and well equipped  I was more than happy overall but would recommend letting everything bed-in a little  Problems;  Location - on Pattaya 3rd road so I needed to cross 3rd Road and Bhuoakao before getting to Soi Diana (which is the center for my holidays in Pattaya)  Teething Problems - the hairdryer was delivered to my room on the 13th day of my holiday / no bin in the bathroom / high technology room management system (generally excellent) failed to let me in on one occasion  Room Service - friendly and competent but clearly new and needed a bit more experience  Japanese - the hotel was full of Japanese people so expect (if a Westerner) to suffer looks ranging from terror to hatred, doors slammed in your face and people marching into the lift before you have a chance to get out. Japanese tourists tend to stay in their groups but Thailand would be better if they went a little further and established Japanese-only hotels so the rest of the world would be spared the arrogance Duggy44 wrote a review Mar 2016\n",
      "40 New hotel, pleasant stay This hotel has been open only for a few weeks. As a consequence, there are still some construction issues going on around the hotel. For instance, they just completed the access driveway and are still in the process of putting in windows on the main floor of the hotel. There is also some furniture that has not been placed into rooms yet in the hallways of various floors. In addition they just opened the second bank of elevators so access to the upper floors is more convenient that it was just a few days ago.  The rooms are airy and light, with very comfortable beds, excellent showers and nice new furniture.  The only real drawback I have found is that it is not truly centrally located being on third Road towards the south end of Pattaya . However, it is only a five minute walk to Soi Buakhao via Soi Lemkee. There is a family mart located approximately one block away from the hotel. Several good restaurants are located nearby as well.    One of the best features of this hotel is that you can access wireless Internet for up to four different pieces of equipment in each room. The Internet is very strong and I have had no difficulties using it at any time. Each room is also equipped with a large television and a wide variety of channels With Thai, English, Chinese and Russian stations  Dining facilities are still being worked on but there is a breakfast available for 150 baht with a variety of items. This will probably increase as the hotel gets more customers. sanget wrote a review Feb 2016\n"

I chose this hotel as they give good service and your can trust that they deliver their promises. The pickup at the airport was also on time. ne0andersen wrote a review Feb 2022\n",
      "10 Disgusting! I was supposed to be picked up from the airport by a limousine. I was sent to a minibus. I called the hotel, they sent an agent looking for, who put me on a minibus me which I had to share with another guy. We couldn't leave straight away because we had to wait for the other guy to have a cigarette. The air con in the mini bus was didn't work and it stunk of cigarettes. I sweated most of the way and the driver was playing some loud rubbish music on videos.    I arrived at the hotel feeling pretty bad after such a long time traveling and being let down by the transport.    I called reception at 7:30 p.m. as no one contact me about food the staff told me to use 7-Eleven. I was in quarantine!!! I told her my meals are supposed to be inclusive she said she would get the the kitchen to call me. After nearly an hour I had had no call, so I went down to reception, arranged for someone to come to my room with a list of food on it, an hour after I was promised somebody would call me.    There are no instructions in the room whatsoever about Covid, just the usual tourist brochure!    This room was probably nice when the hotel first opened, which must have been a long time ago. The floor is dirty, the room smells damp, there is mold on the ceiling. The freezer box in the fridge was frozen solid.    Lots of furnishings and remote controls have plastic covers over them. I don't know how long they have been there, some are falling of, there's no wet wipes or anything available for me to sterilize things myself. I think the room was cleaner when I left than it was when I checked in.    I contacted the Sales Manger from the minibus. He took 3 days to respond!    I contacted Pakpoom XXXX telling him about the \"bad experience\" I was having. He took 5 days to respond. He asked me for details, I gave him the above details nearly 3 weeks ago, he still has not responded! ThailandSplendor wrote a review Jan 2022\n",

      "10 Terrible!! No quarantine here! Pay attention!!! I hardly ever do bad reviews but this hotel deserves it all! I did the 14 days covid quarantine here .... bad experience !!!  The view of the room is horrible, (old and destroyed palace view). The food provided by the hotel is of very poor quality. It is NOT allowed to buy most of the food outside the restaurants .... THEY decide what food you can buy and which NOT! because they SAY they are afraid of bad smells !!!!!! But do you realize? I have to stay in a room for 14 days and I can't eat what I want ???????? In the room there is a washing machine but it CANNOT be used due to the covid !!! ahahhahaha Explain to me what the covid has to do with the washing machine ahahahhaha they are crazy! The interior of the room is rather old and ruined, I DO NOT RECOMMEND anyone to do the COVID QUARANTINE here, I have done it twice and in MUCH more beautiful hotels by paying the same amount!

      "30 Do not stay here for qaurantine The day before my flight the hotel indicated the room I had booked and paid for was not available. The hotel indicated they would refund the difference upon my departure. In 15 days of quarantine the hotel cleaned the room once. After the second covid test I was allowed to come out of my room to sit by a closed pool, the parking lot or a spot in front of the hotel. Travel278582 wrote a review Feb 2021\n",

      "40 Good Quality for this area Having stayed at dozens of hotels in Pattaya, I thought I'd give this property a try. It's a bit of a walk but still easy to get around to anyplace you might want to go in Pattaya. They do offer a shuttle service at selected times, but it's a one-way trip. They will take you to Terminal 21, the beach, Central Festival or Walking Street - but, you're on your own to get back! VivaHawaii wrote a review Jun 2020\n",

      "30 Decent stay but? First impression is the last impression So this was my second visit to Thailand in the month of September 2019. Since i was accompanied by my wife and an infant had checked out a lot of hotels online that offered a kitchenette facility. I came across @Mind Premier Suites. The hotel location is pretty decent. Upon arriving was asked to wait for a while since most of the hotels have a check in time of 2pm. But they it was nice they allowed us to check in a little early. Now here comes the drawback. As i got the key to my room, I asked at the reception if someone will take the luggage to our room. To my surprise the receptionist says there is no one and you have to take the luggage yourself to the room. Having come with a family i had quite a few bags that were to be carried and I myself had to push the trolly in the elevator with all bags stacked and take it to my rooms floor (I guess it was 5th floor). This is a total let down for me. Being in hospitality a hotel should ensure that these things are to be taken care of for an easy check in. At this point i was sceptical how my stay would be. But the rooms were good and clean, stay was comfortable. Beig a vegetarian, food is ok. Nothing to rave about. Also the hotel offers a free shuttle service to a designated area which is the best part. The hotel is good. I could have given easily 4.5 rating but they missed on a few points for the issue i faced during check in. As a traveller we are always exhausted post a mid night flight and it becomes pretty unpleasing to face such hassle on day one of arrival. I shall recommend this hotel for stay but if such things happen you need to have patience. I suggest the hotel owner considers this issue and have people to help visitors during check in. I am sure these little things will help you becoming a preferred hotel. Ahh yes..... like most of the hotels, they too charge a 1000 bath deposit so dont be surpirsed :)    Since i was was traveling with family had l Aruniyer wrote a review Sep 2019\n",

Hotel seems to be old coz many fittings and fixtures were not working properly. Our room door was not locking properly. Bathroom door was bend.

Nice big shower. The breakfast was ok, most of the dishes in the bain Marie's were cold, as we often find in Thailand, I also didn't like the pre cooked fried eggs were left on a plate to go cold. Staff were  lovely, the pool was a good size for exercise, and the gym area was well equipped. Booked directly with the hotel and got an excellent price, would stay again if we were in the area.

      "30 Business Stay @Mind Pattaya The @Mind Premises are always quite comfortable with the room, ensuite kitchen and rather timeless decor. The staff is very friendly and helpful at all times. The Premiere @Mind is far from Central Festival or Terminal 21,walk takes about 15 minutes and by motorbike taxi 5 minutes or less for 50-60baht. What I did not enjoy is the breakfast, there is a vast choice of food but your quality is not high and your precooked eggs are cold. Also there background elevator music is a bit painful. The other thing is there room cleaning which is with making the bed done not very thorough in less than 5 minutes, I call it not very clean flyover. The room is quiet and a good choice of TV channels. KhunT0392 wrote a review May 2019\n",

      "30 Good location but rooms looking tired Had to change hotel for last three days of my stay as one I was in originally was closing for renovation and this was the closest.    Its in a quite area and just off Pattaya Klang road and is a good 10 minutes walk to the beach and all the usual entertainment and shopping venues but plenty of opportunity to jump a Bhat bus (only pay 10b for any journey).    Reception staff were very welcoming and explained all facilities including a lift. There is free covered parking and they run a free drop off and pickup bus to some locations in town.    Room had a small kitchenette with fridge, washing machine, two ring hob, kettle and microwave. Strangely despite all this cooking equipment there was no cooking utensils and only two plates and a bowl !!    Unfortunately the kitchen area meant that there was very little wardrobe space for clothes for one person and even less for two guests.    Room was not overly large but had plenty of space and a very large comfortable bed and a lounge by the window and a small table. One thing that was very good was the TV it was good quality of reception and a good selection of channels. I feel this hotel is geared up for Japanese or Chinese guests as they had a lot of TV channels dedicated to both languages plus there was a Japanese style toilet in the bathroom!!    Shower was ok they had a drop shower which did not work but the second normal shower head did work.    I only stayed three nights and despite leaving and putting the make up room sign on the door each day i went out the cleaning staff did not but after asking the reception on my return they delivered towels quickly.    Had a room at the back and was not disturbed by noise and I think which ever room you had unless your a very light sleeper you won't be disturbed.    Room safe was large enough for a laptop and all other valuables.    I did not use the restaurant so cannot comment but prices seemed to be high and the spa treatments were very very overly priced.    Also did not use the pool but it is on the 2nd floor and is small but looked very nice with dedicated towels and was next to a well equipped gym. The changing rooms also had a sauna for each of the sexes.    Plenty of street food stalls near by and a couple of convenience as well.    Overall it was just starting to show its age and looking tired but was good for the price. GloucesterTraveler wrote a review May 2019\n"

      "10 \"Worst receptionist\" \"Robbers & looters\" with class amenitie hotel I booked this hotel for 4 nights..I arrived early on The first day on 6am..asked for a Early check in..was ready to pay..  MakeMyTrip booking id is *NH7514815220474*  but their receptionist named *[-]*she's the worst receptionist I've ever confronted..she refused saying that all the rooms full..& asked me to wait till 2pm.  I believed the possibility that The hotel might be 100% full which I later recognized was a lie.    It was not over by then..she looked at Booking voucher mentioning 2 adults & 1 child in one room and started saying that..only 2 adults can stay in one room.. I'll have to pay for the extra child aged below 12 for all the 3 rooms..and calculated an amount which was half of my Total Booking amount. .    I kept on asking her that The voucher clearly states that the booking has already been done for 2 adults & 1 child..then why I need to pay again..which she didn't had any answers.. because all these people want is loot in any manner.    I was in conversation with make my trip since early morning after she denied the accommodation of extra child..& it took almost 4 hours for guys from mmt to solve it..and then The hotel Manager agreed for my 2 adults &1 child accommodation without any extra cost.    This wasn't over yet ..Ms [-]  Gave us 2 rooms on one floor and 1 room on another floor Knowing that there are kids travelling and all The booking was done in The same PNR.. though I requested two rooms with twin bed and one room with king bed...so she said as per my request there are only twin bed rooms on first floor ..I thought there might be a hotel policy. . still u requested to give rooms on same floor.. Might be on the other day.. but that pathetic arrogant receptionist kept on saying that they Don't have rooms .  It was difficult with kid's to manage on different floors..and to my surprise I Saw adjacent king bed room getting cleaned up on The second day..I rushed to the receptionist and asked if that room can be allotted to me. She denied that a family has booked three rooms and she'll have to give it to them..I said are we idiots..I literally screamed..we also booked 3 rooms..she gave us on different floor's..and now to a foreign family she's giving on same floor... despite my several requests.. after that she made me sit for half an hour and finally changed my rooms.    Also to mention..  # they've trolleys..conceirge department..but she said they don't have bell boys.. can you imagine extent of lies after lies she said..  #  Even on The day of check out they said there is a footwear missing  # on the day of check in..she mentioned not to soil the sofas & duvet covers..else we'll be charged. .I snapped some of the photos from the room..and showed it to the receptionist... clearly mentioning the already soiled sofa. Broken doors....else they would have blamed on us for the same.    Lesson learned  1. Confirm your booking and number of passengers travelling with age prior your arrival .  2. Don't leave The room while the staff is checking the room and it's amenities.. else they'll steal something and blame you.  3. Check The room for any dirt stains...broken furniture.. rooms amenities.. else you'll be blamed  4.

      "50 good place for an extended stay guest friendly hotel. service friendly staffs.  breakfast spread is good. swimming pool is maintained well, though it is tiny- about 5 ft * 20 ft with a max. depth of 1.2 m. room has mini fridge, washing machine, oven, gas and a few utensils which should help in cooking ready to make foods/ warming up foods. it had Sauna as well.

Got myself another room accross the street for 350, until 14:00.... Guy at reseption was rude. This is not the way to treat people after a long night travel. Never again.

Lady at reception is not welcoming but instead she focus on explaining rules first and take security deposit. She is bit harsh.  You don’t feel like welcoming here.  We were couple and anyways had to spend most of time roaming around and nothing much to do in hotel.  Room is really great and had all facilities at reasonable price. Breakfast buffet is also great and best.  It is around 1+ km from beach and other happenings around.  Only thing I can see as improvement is that lady at reception should be humble and welcoming. I can understand the rules but there is a way to address it and also welcoming guests.  I would not stay here with kids but as a couple is ok.  Overall great room to stay.

Staff at the reception where extremely helpful with any of our inquiries, big thank you to Alex who was very patient with us and gave us help with any of our questions    Only con i could say about the hotel is that it would be far from Walking street, but that been said short walk to the main road and a 10 baht bus will bring you there in about 5-10 minutes, will be my hotel of choice when i am back in Pattaya Tuckkatoon K wrote a review Nov 2018\n",
      "50 One of the greatest place to stay in Pattaya This was my 5th time stayed with this hotel. Hotel staffs at Front Desk and Housekeeping were always friendly and helpful. Room was always clean and comfortable. Some other reasons for me to keep choosing At Mind Premier Suite are…  1) the room is equipped with washing machine.  2) hotel is very close to Central Pattaya Road, Pattaya Beach, Big C, food market, Central Festival etc.  3) 7-11 and Family Mart is close by.  4) reasonable price.    Even though, I found the water temperature was not stable when I took shower. It was nice and warm, and became cold or hot rapidly. Another couple of suggestions…  1) when choosing the room is getting the room on higher floors. There is another hotel, which is occupied by Indians, right next to it. They made noise on the street, shouted at balcony all night long.  2) it will be great to have 2 key cards per room. I know it’s a way on energy saving. But when traveling as couple or staying with friends, it’s really inconvenient.  3) it will also be great if hotel can provide a rack to hang wet clothes    I think this is one of the best options to stay in Pattaya. I’ll come and stay again for sure. OmarLien wrote a review Oct 2018\n"

      "50 Summer holidays You cannot wish for more at this price range. The service is good, staff are friendly and nice, and place is clean. Only improvement is the floor of the shower, water leaks.    The pool is too small but good enough for exercise. The restaurant food can see the chef has put heart into it. Right across from hotel is convenient store. Need to watch the kids when walking out the hotel as you are sharing the narrow street with 2 way traffic.    200 Baht to take the whole Tuk Tuk to Central Plaza and 10min away. Must visit the rate of exchange at 3min walks from Central Festival plaza front entrance facing the ocean.    I will definitely try with family at the At Mind Exclusive. The place is much quieter and not much difference on price. Kc Sun wrote a review Oct 2018\n",

      "20 Nothing in the hotel was good enough to be rated! It was a disappointing experience to stay here. The location is claimed to be central, for it is quite inside and for everything you either need a motorbike or grab. The amenities also looked quite old, right from toiletries, to bathroom fittings, wardrobe light, everything was poor. The wardrobe's light used to be on while closing and reverse while opening. It kept blinking the whole night, so we had to fix it ourselves. They give washing machine and kitchenette in room, but no washing basics. And they will charge you for that. The cleaning staff doesn't even have the basic decency to ring the doorbell to check if the guests are inside their rooms. They just use their key and walk-in like their own place. Highly disgusted and annoyed. ekta p wrote a review Oct 2018\n",

Rooms are spacious and well equipped (microwave, laundry machine, cutlery, etc.). There’s small swimming pool on premises, which allows for some proper swimming exercise. Internet is not the fastest, yet should suffice for most activities. Bed is quite hard though and room air is too moist, humidity smell is quite pronounced inside. Nice and fairly big car park.  All in all, good accommodation option for rather short stays around central Pattaya. Mr_Nobody_1979 wrote a review Sep 2018\n",

      "20 Not great Had an OK stay, although didn’t spend much time there due to meeting family elsewhere.    Gym was a bit lame and no air con.    Never any towels by the pool area and often no sun beds.    Breakfast basic and eggs always undercooked.    Worst point was we asked for a taxi to UTP airport and knew it should be about 800-900 baht we were quoted 1400 by receptionist who refused to call us a meter taxi. Very strange. We used Grab, as I did a quick google, and it did cost only 800. So I am really disappointed that this hotel receptionist felt the need to overcharge us and maybe even get a cut on this.    Finally there is quite loud construction going on outside hotel so if your room is to the back of the hotel, you may well be woken up by loud drilling noises. christianbullen wrote a review Aug 2018\n",

Close to Buakhao, and lots of food / massage etc.  Curtains are quite light and let in the sun a bit. The deluxe room is a nice size.

So it was quite reassuring to check back into At Mind Premier suites and find everything was just as to be expected. The same excellent service from the moment you check in where Nok was her usual efficient self to the always cheerful and thorough maids and the rest of the helpful staff. It's always reassuring to know that in the midst of change there are some things you can rely on.  I think this hotel offers excellent value for money. 142am66 wrote a review Jun 2018\n",

Must say the water of the shower gets hot/cold and the pressure could be a bit higher. Anyways the photos you see are spot on nothing more to add.    Area: you're off from all the night life so you can have a good solid rest. +- 10 to 15mins walk to central festival or beachroad. SO not too far from all the action also.

May I say a very belated Happy New Year2018 to all that staff at @Mind Premier Suite  I’ve lost count of how many times I've stayed here the one member of staff who always stands out is Nok she is so helpful as is everyone who works here.    The photos are very much spot-on the rooms are very clean with a small balcony.  As you see from the photos it is equipped with a very nice Samsung flat screen TV, the kitchenette comes with washing machine, microwave and induction oven and mini-fridge    The bathroom is very bright and I’ve always had a room with a separate bath and shower  My one criticism is that they should use thermostatically controlled taps in the shower as the water temperature keeps changing  If you’ve taken the option of having a breakfast included with your say, You’ll have a buffet choice of Thai, Chinese and European breakfast  Don’t worry about how far it is from Walking St it’s too far from the main road and there is a motorbike taxi stand outside  Housekeeping attend to your room every day (Thankfully they come late afternoon for you late risers)  The hotel is very well run and the staff great too always happy to help with everything you need    Thank you for wonderful stay @mind will be seeing you soon (in 4 week time) Lee F wrote a review Jan 2018\n",

These are all modern well furnished and maintained offering excellent value for money situated in quiet but convenient locations in both cities.  Although not the largest or the one with the best swimming pool or what some might consider the best location my favourite is At Mind Premier Suites where I've stayed many times. I say this because of the especially warm reception that all guests receive from a staff that have been there since the hotel opened. The staff go out of their way way to be helpful dealing patiently and cheerfully with an international clientele. It's always a delight to see Nok's smiling face when after a long flight and who completes the arrival process extremely quickly meaning you are in your room very quickly and relaxing in a comfortable room. 142am66 wrote a review Sep 2017\n",

      "40 Great choice for couple Beside a little bit far from the beach and doesn't have great view. The place is excellent choice for couple. Cheap price for big fancy room with great services, quiet at night. Many different facility such as swimming pool, gym, massages and sauna are available to use. Near the place has many market, restaurant and pub for entertainment. Ninh H wrote a review May 2017\n",
      "30 Better deals in Pattaya I first booked it for 1000b per night, but there was a confusion with my booking 5 night booking, and only one night showed up at 1000b. They made me pay 1500 for the other nights. The room, was fine, but I rented it for the weight room and swimming pool. Only one person can swim at a time in the pool, and the treadmill wouldn't work. Such better deals down the road. The front lobby was useless. DavidDakanAllison wrote a review May 2017\n",

      "40 Great place in Pattaya The place is good overall - nice rooms, decent breakfast, and good facilities. We took the superior suite, a slightly bigger than the average and with boasting amenities - hot/cold rain shower, small kitchen, your own washing machine/dryer, mini sala and a queen size comfy bed. For the breakfast, I have been seeing lots of comment about it being 'standard', well in fact for the price that you paid for, it's actually more. but the only con I have is the dish which is repetitive - so it takes out the drive to eat bfast on your 2nd day - dishes are: fruits and salad bar, cereals section, freshly made pancakes, 3-4 other dishes mainly veggies, meat/fish, 2 soups, a small dimsum portion, locally baked pastries and a freshly brewed coffee for every cup. Facilities are nice: small gym with basic equipments, swimming pool - *correcting this again*, Based on the comments - it only fits 2, of which is half true only if you want to do laps by yourselves.. the pool stretches to a 10-12m length I guess? sauna for men and women that comfortably sits 1 each - only con is the slow raising of temp inside - been 5mins but very little effect still . The place also has a free parking slot so I suggest when going to Pattaya is to rent a motorbike to travel around, this will save you money and less hassle (200 baht/rent + 50 baht for estimate gas per day) *1,000 baht refundable deposit. alfred u wrote a review Apr 2017\n"

      "40 Nice Nice and very clean room. They even have stove, microwave and washing machine in the room. Bathroom with tub and shower. Helpful staff. Covered parking. The only problem with this hotel is the location eventhough very convenient to many restaurants.Situated in a small street off Central Pattaya road so do not expect any view from the room. Narrow and long swimming pool next to the gym. jesda wrote a review Mar 2017\n",
      "40 Great service at an affordable price! I stayed for 5 days, was upgraded to the Deluxe Room - which included all the amenities of a studio apt. The room was up to date, clean and spacious. I liked the open floor plan, didn't feel confined while in the room. The location is convenient to Central Pattaya Road, just a short walk, and about a 10 minute walk to the beach. Need to be a bit careful walking from the hotel to Central Road as there are many motorbikes and other vehicles that also travel on the street - there are no sidewalks!  Due to the location of my room, 8th floor and street side, I did hear a lot of noise in my room coming from the motorbikes below, which was the only drawback to my visit.  Breakfast was excellent, great service, room affordably priced, the hotel staff were friendly, helpful, and pleasant to talk with! usmc1032fit wrote a review Mar 2017\n",

We did not get to try the pool due to packed schedule. The location is a little bit far from the main road, but no need to worry, there are many Songthaew passing this hotel ready to take you anywhere.

Very nice and clean hotel and the all staff is polite and helpful and made us feel welcome. We were 4 together in 2 rooms and we wanted something quiet and comfortable and not too far away from the all attractions. It takes 15-20 minutes to walk to the beach.    Our room were on 8th floor, quiet enough from the street noise. Every room had a fridge, microwave, washing machine and coffee maker. Bed was very good but the pillows too thick and hard. Nice bathroom with both shower and tub.    Our cleaning lady was a wonderful woman who worked every single day and made her job very well. She was very friendly, always smiling and we hope she gets paid a good salary. The hotel can be proud to have her as a employee. :)    Breakfast was alright. It had been nice to have a little change. Almost the same food every morning. The hotel have a great swimming pool, gym and sauna.    We recommend this hotel and will definitely stay there again. KatrinArena wrote a review Feb 2017\n",

It has a sister hotel nearby, at mind service residence nearby, which is bigger in size and located nearer to the main road but older buildings.    There are a few eateries out on the main road.

Small details like solid wifi, outlets and switches organization, comfy couch, modern TV with YouTube broadcast support, quality robe made me stay in my room few extra hours before adventuring out in the humid and noisy city life.

      "40 Better rent a bike On the first day of check-in, the Superior Room was slightly smaller than the photo, probably due to the full room. We were accommodated in a 2nd floor room with disabled access, so the entrance was large and the bathroom was also in the bathroom. Big, (no bath door), and out of the point, that no microwave in room, the receptionist answer is if something to heat, call them to help.    Toilet only shampoo + nourishing liquid, soap and hand lotion, but each is only half a bottle, even clean up the room the next day, but also refill for half a bottle (do not know why), I have asked for exchange room, but receptionist said only after 1pm and we need to keep our luggage and storage at their office if we are not around, due to we staying there for 5 night and really feel trouble repack all the stuff, so we just keep staying the same room. Room TV has more than 40 channels, but most channels are no sound.    We staying on the 2nd floor, just beside the Pattaya loft hotel (many Indians staying), in evening will be a little noisy, where there will be Miss lady downstairs at night, plus their ultra-loud speech, a bit annoying. (Sometimes noisy to 2-3 points). please avoid night time to the balcony, mosquito bite.    Breakfast (6am - 10am) choices a little less, basically the same every day, there is no halal food, most of it pork food, taste Ok, most of the staffs know a little basic English, communication ok, but they do not understand mandarin (In the first day I helped them translate to Chinese tourists).    In 3rd day I forgot to request clean our room, when we come back at night called the reception for my bath towel, they replace in just take two minutes, very good!    The location of this hotel are not so convenient, every time when going to the attracting point (even the beach road), you still need to book at less a bike taxi, and is not cheap for tourist, advice to those staying more than 3 days, you can rent a bike.    Finally, the hotel's staff is very friendly, always keep smiling face. Stevencwk85 wrote a review Nov 2016\n"

      "50 Great for a young family We are staying at the @Mind at the moment. The place it's very nice to stay at, staff are helpful and friendly. We have a very young baby with us and it's ideal having a washing machine in the room, so we are able to wash all her stuff and ours on a daily basis. Who would of thought a baby could cause so much washing!!!    The only gripe I would have is that the breakfast is cold most days, as there are not always heaters under some of the European food, so it is very hit and miss as to weather you catch it when there's warm food available. When asked they have got me some heated food, but surely it would be better if it was just kept warm to start with. Jerry C wrote a review Nov 2016\n",

We only paid 5,244baht for 3 nights!! We didnt go out that much because we loved staying at the hotel. The room was cozy! Breakfast is okay. Pretty much the same everyday-scrambled eggs, fried eggs, fried rice. Well they change up the soup everyday and the stir fry chicken to stir fry pork. There's a pancake maker too! Plenty of fruits to choose from! Plus veggies if you're into salad, the have a salad bar. They also have a pool, a gym and A SAUNA!!! Family mart and 711 near the hotel. Taxi and motorcycle drivers always confuse this hotel with the other one (at mind serviced residence). I think the hotel is called At Mind 2.

      "40 Pleasent stay spoiled by rude staff I stayed in the property for five nights. This is a brand new property, in the close proximity of another at mind property. I booked this hotel, confused with the other at mind property which I used during my earlier visits.  However I was not disappointed after checking in. The property is new, aethetically designed and impeccably maintained.  The hotel has a small pool, a small gym and a tiny spa ( barely fits one person ) on the second floor, but all the facility work fine and are maintained nicely.  The food was okay and so was the housekeeping.  Overall a decent experience, barring a small incident during check out.  I booked a hotel car for bangkok airport at 2.30 am in the morning, with the request of a wake up call at 2.00 am, since it was very early. The gentleman manning the front desk forgot to pass on this message to the person. As a result I got late by 20 mins to come to reception.  At this time the guy at the reception literally shouted on me for being late. I took an offence for such a reaction and wanted to speak to someone senior, since this kind of behaviour from a hospitality industry staff is nothing short of a crime.  In my 20 years of travelling experience, I never had such a experience.  This one bad apple undid the excellent work of all the other wonderful staff and management of the property and made us leave with a bad taste.  I would urge the management to look into this issue .  I am happy to recommend this property to my friends and members of the forum, because barring one incident the overall stay and experience in the property was good.

      "30 Newer hotel. We previously stayed at the 'older' @ Mind, just a few minutes walk away.  The hotel itself, once you get past the barking ankle-biting small dogs that belong to one of the shops beside the hotel, is new, fresh, and fairly clean.  The reception staff could do with some staff training by the manager,Mr Monchai who is himself, very pleasant and helpful, and willing to lend an ear to issues.  The pool.....probably not a pool for sun-lovers, as the very few sunbeds are under an overhang that never sees the sun. The pool itself is small and narrow.  The gym is fairly well-equipped, but the staff need to learn to keep the doors closed, and the AC on.... at present it's more like a sauna than a gym.  Breakfast is not amazing but OK....eggs are always cold, for some reason, as they are at the other @ Mind. However, the breakfast staff are always pleasant and helpful.  The room itself.....nice layout, with enough storage space. The kitchen area would be serviceable if it had any cooking utensils....not a pot or pan to be seen. Just 4 odd plates, 2 knives, and 2 forks.  However, a fantastic washing machine that works quietly and quickly. Maybe a clothes drying rack on the balcony, which is too small for sitting on, would be a good option.  Wifi in the room is decent.  Good-sized bathroom, with probably the best 3-way shower we've seen, and great towels. Loved it!  A bit far from the action if you dislike walking. The road it's on is narrow, with too-fast traffic and no sidewalk. Central Road is just 5 minutes or so away, with another 5 minutes down to Second Road, to the baht bus.  The hotel is still lacking a few facilities, like a room directory and room service menu, if room service is actually an option. We were shown, in the dining room some kind of limited room-service menu, which we'd have to come down to the dining room to order from. (Isn't the whole point of room service that you don't need to leave the room??)  There's a Family Mart a couple of minutes' walk away, luckily the other direction to the snapping dogs.  If you're in Pattaya for the beach or the pool, this is probably not the best place to stay.  However, if you're on business and need a clean new place to stay, it's probably OK. mamasue111 wrote a review Mar 2016\n",
      "30 Newly Opened - Not quite there yet! I had previously stayed in the At Mind Serviced Residence and as such confidently guided my taxi driver there from the airport. Arriving at check-in I was told no I was staying in the other building. Some confusion later I arrive at the correct location. Tip - do not try to take you bags in to reception on your own; either ask your driver to help or go and get someone to help you (no concierge eagerly awaiting to assist you) I did not get help and struggled with the main doors which are not automatic. All this was watched in amusement by the reception staff and parking attendant.  I checked-in with no further problems and was shown to my room. After unpacking I began to find some issues (possibly because I was the first guest in that room, but am not sure)  1. Although this was a studio apartment; there were no pots and pans to do any cooking  2. The TV channels had not been programmed - and even after doing so there was no English Language Channel available (The serviced residence At Mind had at least HBO)  3. No DVD player provided (is available in other building)  4. Washing Machine provided, but no airer to dry laundry. So most of the time I was trying to drape wet clothes over doors and on furniture.  5. The balcony is small with no furniture  6. It is ridiculously overlooked on the non-pool side. There is another serviced apartment block directly across the narrow street and you could see into the rooms. This resulted in me spending my entire time that I was in the room with the curtains drawn.  7. The restaurant is a downscaled version of the sister property, with less menu choice and also the breakfast has fewer options available in terms of fresh fruit. The coffee was fantastic, juices not so. The bar also did not stock any wine; and after I resorted to a back up of G&T I received a phone call to say no tonic ! As there is no shortage of Family Marts and 7-Elevens in the area I went for take away!  8. Towels were not available at the gym or pool area and there was no one in attendance if you wanted to order a drink or snack. Equipment in the gym is basic. Tip - get someone to show where the aircon controls are as they are not easy to see and it is not turned on as a matter of course to keep the gym cool.  9. It took days for me to get a copy of an invoice (I wanted to make a part payment of the period that had passed)  10. Check that room service leave you toilet roll! On many days I would return to find that there was none in my room!  That aside; the staff were polite and friendly, the pool area was clean and quiet (not sure for how long).In my opinion this hotel is better suited to couples or business travelers.

      "50 Superb Hotel, Great Value for money Just spent 6 nights in this new hotel and to say the least, I am very impressed.  I have stayed in many Pattaya Hotels in the past but this is by far the best for value and service. Location is quite handy if you know your way around, but it is off the main roads and that makes it a nice quiet place to stay.  The staff are excellent and the room we had (King Studio) was large and very well appointed with washing machine, mini kitchen etc, It was kept immaculately clean by the housekeeping team.  The hotel has a nice pool, a reasonably good gym and saunas for guest use.  Breakfast is a buffet, mainly asian but they do have a very nice spread and the service is very good.Staff are attentive and during the whole stay the buffet was maintained 'full' all the time.  On site parking is very good, with security.  Hotel is very guest friendly and we would not hesitate to stay here again.

It was very spacious, it had a kitchenette with hobs, microwave, cutlery, plates etc, I even had a washing machine in the room which was very convenient. There was a bath and a separate shower. As the hotel has only recently been built everything is brand new and pristine. The staff are great and on the ball. I needed help twice during my stay with my internet connection however the fault was with my laptop and not the hotels connection but they had an engineer at my door within 2 mins both times to help. The hotel isnt far from all the action as its close to the far end of soi baukoew. Taxi bikes right outside will take you to LK Metro area for 40baht or Walking Street for 60baht. This was top accomodation with very tasteful decor with very keen and polite staff. I paid only around 1200 baht a night for this price i cannot give it less than 10/10. I have stayed in many many hotels in Pattaya over the years and you wont beat this place, a great find that im sure i will be returning to very soon. Neil G wrote a review Feb 2016\n"

      "50 An awesome vacation. I just got back from my holiday and wow was it an awesome one. One such person who I need to mention is Scott the owner of Bua Khao Paradise. He is the most pleasant and helpful person you shall ever meet. The rooms are well maintained and clean. The staff friendly and the food is amazing. I shall definitely stay here the next time I come to pattaya. Thank you Scott for everything... Randy wrote a review Sep 2019\n",
      "50 Stay in Pattaya Just got back home after a 2 week stay here and i must stay its an absolute gem of a place to stay.  The location is great the rooms are very large and exceptionally clean.  The food is first class and very varied and very reasonably priced.  Owners Scotty and Milk are tremendous hosts and nothing is too much trouble, the staff are very friendly, polite and efficient.  I cant wait to return in November and i fully recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to stay in Pattaya you wont be disappointed.  Thank you very much Scotty and Milk for making mine and Leela,s stay a real pleasure.  Derrick S Relax246944 wrote a review Jul 2019\n",
      "50 Smiling Staff, Clean Rooms, & Great Food! I decided to go to Pattaya for a day, as I had never been there before. A friend had recommended to me to stay there. The food was awesome!! At dinner I had the Thai green curry, papaya salad and chicken bites and lots of Heineken beer!!! For breakfast I had the ham and egg omelette with cheese and toast. Both meals were very good and the service was quick. The restaurant and room was very clean! There is free WiFi and water in the rooms. The location is central to all the main attractions and is 5 minutes from the ferry terminal.    If you’re looking for a very affordable room with great service, awesome food, clean rooms and very friendly staff this is the place for you!! I definitely recommend sitting and having a beer with the owners!! Rig_Manager wrote a review Jan 2019\n",
      "50 Great food at very fair prices: a hidden gem on Soi Buakhow This bar/restaurant/guesthouse has very recently re-opened under new management through On from Thailand and Scotty from Canada.    We lunched magnificently on Thai green curry (chicken), pork spare ribs, seafood fried rice and whole (large) red snapper prepared in Thai chilli sauce. All the food was fantastic and freshly prepared, as well as being favourably priced...for example, the fabulously tasty red snapper, was only 259 baht, and the whole meal , including drinks came in at about 850 baht.    The rest of the menu looked great, with a good range of Thai and western dishes. While we were in , some other customers were enjoying a late breakfast , which looked excellent, and included tea/coffee and (genuinely) freshly-squeezed orange juice.    Located on Soi Buakhow, half-way between Soi Diana and South Pattaya Road (Pattaya Tai), this friendly and relaxed little eatery/bar is certainly worth a visit when in downtown Pattaya Freddie P wrote a review Jan 2019\n",
      "50 Stay pattaya Great little hotel with fantastic staff and tasty food my stay here was welcomed with a great host it has a bar and restaurant downstairs and the rooms where nicely decorated and clean. The prices are very competitive against other similar places here Stuart M wrote a review Mar 2018\n",
      "50 Great Stay! I stayed for over a week. I was very well greeted by the staff. They have a good level of English that allowed for good exchanges. The room was very clean and quiet despite proximity to a rather full and festive bar.I met a number of other travellers and their experience was as positive as mine. The location was quite central allowing me to go to Bankok as well as other key sites within Pataya (beach...) 66lehodey wrote a review Feb 2018\n",

      "40 Great stay! friendly staff and perfect location Great hotel in a very good location! from the outside the places looks pretty dingy with very little characteristic. nonetheless, the rooms are spacious and clean and love the theme used in each individual room, i had the London room which had all sorts of themes from the wall pictures to the sheets of the bed! practical room with all the essentials, kettle, mini fridge stocked with goodies! Not much of a view.    Friendly and helpful staff, very poor english the always willing to try and learn! great coffee, never ate here so i cant say anything about their food.    Perfect location, walking distance to beach and the famous \"Walking Street\" lined with shops, bars and restaurants to keep you busy for hours. yet close enough to all city and night life and yet far enough to get a good night sleep!    i would definitely stay here again if i ever return to Pattaya and i would recommend this place to anyone! Reasonably priced! sam2066 wrote a review Mar 2017\n",
      "30 good option, if you are on a budget it is a guesthouse, so don't expect a lot. It does not have elevator, so be careful if your bags are heavy, you will have to take them up the stairs. Room is big, but basic. Bathroom was basic too. Some cleaning is needed, specially under the beds JMPFF wrote a review Feb 2017\n",
      "50 Good place to stay Excellent location.  Very friendly staff.  Recommended for a short stay in Pattaya, with easy access to almost everything there.  Only downside is its surrounding noise, specially in the morning, with the holiday inn construction site around the corner, and guesthouse workers start to get active for the day.

Stayed a little out of town when first got here saving money. This hotel is cheaper and more central. Dont expect the Marriot but for the price you cannot go wrong. Pedro B wrote a review Feb 2019\n",
      "10 Never again... You can find much better quality/price in Pattaya! Hotel was really poor. Room was dated, tv was ok with international channels, no kettle available, no view, no telephone... Impossible to sleep during the night (at least until 03:00) due to intense noise from downstairs. Stairs not suitable for elderly people. 4 floors and no lift. Breakfast was really basic with 2 or 3 choices. Cleaning could be much better. Location is ok if you want to be close to the night life, avoid if you want to rest.

      "10 Beware of the safety box thieves Stayed here multiple times during 2017-2018. The gratitude shown was multiple times money was stolen from my room safe. Many, many other guests had money stolen as well. The money is stolen in smaller amounts in the hope that it isn’t noticed. On one occasion I had $500 taken which the owner, Thomas paid me back. Others were not so lucky and were out of pocket. It has been going on for a long time now. Unfortunately I didn’t book through Agoda or Booking.com so am unable to write reviews on there. I have seen others write about it though. Obviously it is an inside job, if not all the valuables would be taken. I had future bookings at DaTomas and after I complained to Thomas, he abruptly cancelled my bookings, even though I was arriving within 5 days at the beginning of December, making it difficult source an alternative Hotel Ian_55_54 wrote a review Dec 2018\n",

The rooms are basic but very clean and has all the amenities  ..ac, TV and mini bar...what else.you need.location is fantastic and the ladies are super friendly. And all of this at a fantastic price.

Datomas is located right in the city center and is really close to Central Festival and Beach Road. A plenty of eateries, bars and cheap massage salons are just in the neighborhood.  Perfect Wi-Fi, the connection is always fast and stable.  This guest house is a nice place for young people and couples. I highly recommend it! marine_rosemarine wrote a review Jan 2017\n",
      "50 Great On soi Honey near soi Buakou.  Great place to stay in the heart of all the attraction. Chose large room. Plenty space. Complimentary water everyday. Room cleaned everyday. Fan and a/c.  Clean towels everyday.  Staff good and speak good English.  Good rates and cheaper the longer you stay.  Would definitely stay here again. tim m wrote a review Dec 2016\n",
      "40 Cheap, clean rooms in the heart of town Yeh its good and cheap at just 700 or so baht per night. All rooms seem to have balcony and fridge, safe box, free fast wifi.  It is actually basically identical to harrys place a couple of doors down. Eveything is the same etc for the wardrobes.  As with other places on the soi these rooms are above a bar. Although its a pretty quiet bar. I barely ever saw any customers anywhere here. Staff are quite happy and jovial all the time and nobody was rude or anything.  Bed was very hard like a rock. Thats the only real negative i can think of.  I really think they have let themselves down here by being so hard to contact. I only know about the place from walking past and seeing it. Searching google and facebook trying to get a email or phone number for the place turned up nothing. Tripadvisor also doesnt have the details. I did mention and they said they have a facebook page but i certainly couldnt find it. Given that harrys place is ranked high on tripadvisor and this place is near identical i really think they would be missing out on a lot of business being uncontactable.  Anyway. Good cheap rooms and friendly staff. Good for those on a budget. nak_lang wrote a review Jul 2016\n",
      "40 CLEAN ! FRIENDLY, and GOD VALUE ! PROS  - the owner was hospitable and friendly - and did give me a quiet room, great for sleeping !  - the reception staff were friendly and helpful, and always greeted me, coming and going - the guesthouse was well-located: near BuoKao (sp) Rd, and a mere walk to SaiSong-- easy for catching the songtheows  - the housekeeping staff did a thorough job of cleaning : )  -the guesthouse was in great physical shape--quite well maintained !    CONS  - even tho the tag 'Please clean my room' hung on the doorknob, no one would come at all to clean until I came down the three flights of stairs to the reception !  - a couple times when they took the towels, there was only ONE set of towels, instead of two !  - a new bar of soap,was given only if I specifically asked for it, even tho there was none left in the bathroom !  - no food available to buy on premises : plenty of places + vendors nearby !

      "50 BEAUTIFUL PLACE We enjoyed our recent stay at this hotel.  The staff both at the reception and in the restaurant are very kind, smiling and always ready to help you.  We took advantage of the very well maintained swimming pool.  The breakfast buffet is impeccable with a wide variety of products offered.  On several occasions we have eaten in the restaurant and have always been very satisfied with both the drinks and the food.  We can only recommend this hotel where we will return on our next trip to Thailand. eiram3002 wrote a review Jan 2022\n",

      "40 Excellent high end hotel on beach road I enjoyed staying at Mera Mare. Its an attractive hotel with nice rooms and bar fridge with beers and spirits. Good views. Bed is a bit hard. Reception offered a solution when I told them.    The pool is really nice and gym ok.    The lift is annoying with TV going and loud promotional music. They should turn this down to the lowest volume. Very tedious to hear this every time one enters the lift.    One night I walked back inside the lobby at 9pm and the old receptionist quickly asked my room number. I told her and then she started asking me about breakfast. I was not interested in trivial conversations about breakfast at that time of the night and thought it was quite funny to be honest. They could perhaps give staff training to that worker to use a more friendly tone in her voice.    Overall, I highly recommend this hotel. Its a great option! abooking wrote a review Jul 2021\n",
      "50 Great location, nice room and tasty food. Great location : Nearby beach and close to the mall.  Nice room : Large room and balcony. Nice and clean.

When I picked the cake, the chef bakery, “khun Pia” walked in and casually introduced the cake. The cakes and drinks at this shop are delicious. I am happy to come to this restaurant.

      "20 3 days in Pattaya Staff in morning was friendly . We felt welcomed when we checked in.    Hygiene - washroom and bathroom is always cleaned well. House keeping does a great job.  But if you spill any sugar / food the next moment when you come back to your hotel room you will notice ants . I think they should have a way of getting rid of ants crawling over the counter with coffee and sugar cream area. Gets pretty annoying. I had to clean up and put the sugar cream in fridge. Not convenient and you don’t have this issue in good hotel.    Set up of room : it’s nice.    Service after check out : Rude when they ask for slippers missing. You are not suppose to be reusing them. People could be having sweaty feet . It’s very unhygienic. People have calluses , corn or some kind of feet disease that can spread. How can they be re using it. I never knew until they asked where is the slippers. We don’t mind paying for it which we did 300 but it’s suppose to be free. Not a lot when u convert to Canadian CAD but still It’s common sense to Give it away or throw the slippers and stop being so cheap . It just puts me off. If my bag wasn’t locked I would have gave it ! I just didn’t know if it was in my luggage or my friends luggage.    There is beach right outside but it’s not the best beach. Not very clean. You can just walk around the city eat shop and drink. Do massage and relax .seafood amazing.    Not acceptable ! DETHINLILIAN T wrote a review Nov 2019\n",

Very Modern and nicely decorated lobby.Comfortable rooms.It has avery good pastry shop and restaurant serving good breakfast. The Gum and pool are just moderate it does not have separate bar and at late hours about 10 pm the lobby is dark with lights dimmed and just one staff at reception. On the negative side the The Front Office staff is very unfriendly and uncooperative and adamant pn small issues.When requested to charge my cell phone as I had problem with my cell charger was rudely told that this facility cannot be given to guests. Even during check in were received with very indifferent attitude. Rajendra Govind D wrote a review Nov 2019\n",

      "40 Excellent location The location is just perfect ... you get down the hotel and you have a sea beach.. Loved their interiors ...very well designed !!! kudos to that.  The security and front desk were superb ..loved how they go about their job .    Would have rated it a 5 star but what irked me up is that.... while checking out my friend had kept the bathroom slippers in his bag which were used for 2 days....( which i assume is complimentary in every hotel)  during check out he was asked for 300 TBH as the Housekeeping informed one pair is missing....my only question is are you giving used bathroom slippers to the new customers and if not then why charge 300 TBH ??    As for WHEELCHAIR USER .... it has an access to the room without any hassle but they don't have a room specially for wheelchair user which they claim on many websites.  The washroom has a bathtub , only if you can manage to use that for taking a bath i suggest you stay here coz the shower area is to small for a chair to fit in. RishabhB7 wrote a review Oct 2019\n",

We had booked 4 rooms and they very courteously provided early check in for all the rooms. The rooms are wonderful with all the basic amenities. All the rooms had attached balconies thereby saving us the trouble of going down at the lobby for a smoke. The food was sumptuous and the buffet breakfast was very elaborate. Ive read in one of the reviews about the room size. Let me tell you that the rooms and very spacious and comfortable. The staff was very polite and made our stay really memorable. Please also try the amazing pasrty shop they have. Vaibhav_PaRaNoId wrote a review Oct 2019\n"

Can you imagine, you were traveling with your family and they were ready to check out but the car is not available, the front desk gave me a lot of excuses. And i got so mad on that time because of the poor action and excuses, i come from hospitality industry as butler in 5 starts hotel as well, i know how this things work.

Quiet and no slamming doors. Nice pool and amazing gym.

      "40 So so 1.Location of Hotel is perfect on main road and Beach facing Hotel.  2.Indian Food not available...  3.Language problem is there .  4.Service is slow.  5.Swimming pool is small.  6.Indian should not book rooms with breakfast.  7.I have booked garden view room and a king size bed room ..but they did not provide me whatever i booked...infact they gave me twin bed sharing rooms...our tour get spoiled..  8.The hotel.is expensive they charge even for ice cubes..and while checking inn they give information that whatever missed items from your room will be charged.  9.In same price hardrock is far far better as hardrock is wall to wall connected to mera mare..  10.over all stay was unpleasant for us and i would not recomend this hotel.to anybody.  11..Also enclosed our booking details in pics attached.

      "40 Almost a 5 star hotel, gorgeous location and lobby, rooms a bit short This brand new hotel in Pattaya right on beach street has chosen a competitive location, right beside the hard rock hotel.    As you enter the hotel, you have a boutique restaurant and a very posh lobby. The staff are very accommodating however there were a few times I felt I was ignored, eg checking in there was 2 customers and 3 staff, I stood there for a few mins before they even acknowledged my presence    The pool is not as good as Hard Rock next door but not many pools do match up to them! but is quite a nice pool. much better than other ones in the area    They have rated themselves as 5 star and we paid $140AUD without breakfast which isnt on the cheap side for the area, they have fairly high standards to meet.    One slight disappointment we had was the rooms, it wasnt overly large but just felt a bit cheap/tacky for a 5 star, some may disagree with me on this one (for the record we stayed in the room with white walls with brick patterns on it)    Overall, small things like location, service made up for short comings that we felt, we would stay again but we'd definitely look around too losttravellerfromoz wrote a review Feb 2019\n",
      "50 Great holiday Just spent 3 weeks here and had a great holiday, just across the road from the beach if you like sun bathing as the pool area  Is small. The coffee shop and restaurant serve good food and the breakfast was varied and plentiful. Couldn’t fault the service everybody tried to be helpful even though they didn’t always understand English but their English was better than my Thai.  The room was very clean and well stocked,good house keeping.  The location is great halfway between Walking Street and the  Dolphin roundabout next door to the Hard Rock(noisy at times)  Thanks to all the staff who made our stay enjoyable. chris-di-tour wrote a review Feb 2019\n",
      "30 Lovely BUT! This is a lovely Hotel, in a good location on the Beach Road, but although the rooms are spacious there is not enough storage for clothing especially if you're staying more than 3 days, we were there for 11 days and had to keep a lot of our things in the suitcases.Breakfast was good, plenty of choice. Now, unbeknownst to us as there is no mention anywhere in there advertising the Hotel next door is \"The Hard Rock hotel and cafe, if you like constant noise and loud rock music you will love this location. Also in the trees in the grounds of the \"Hard Rock\" hotel there nests a bird, this bird is infamous for being the most annoying bird on earth, it's called a Asian Koel you can hear it on Utube.take ear plugs.

It was like just right next to me I was all excited! I got a room with a sea view and I couldn’t stop stepping out my balcony to feel the breeze every morning during my stay. I could also hang my clothes there after wash which is so convenient.    All the staff were very nice they greeted us all the time whenever we saw them. I left my hat in a car they helped contact my driver and settle everything smoothly for me.    The gym and swimming pool are very nice too I had a great time there (except their slow wifi).

Location was Nice Near to Hard Rock Cafe.    Breakfast is terrible, food served in breakfast is Cold as there was issue in there Machines and which cannot keep food hot. I Requested restaurant Manager for Something hot food but was helpless. If they Charge 650 THB for Breakfast/per person is terrible to Pay for quality and Variety.    Restaurant Staff Almost we See Unprofessional And We See Several times they Gossip and talking with each other and playing with each other while working. Some of while Serving or Cleaning were eating Food on Working. I did not like waiters on Job Could eat Food while serving or Cleaning.

The hotel is very new and unspoiled and included breakfast and free wifi in the tariff. I had a room with a lovely Seaview and balcony with sea breeze.I did note there were not a lot of English speaking people staying at this hotel, which wasn’t a problem as the staff spoke English.

      "10 Scam I booked a DELUXE TRIPLE ROOM WITH A VIEW for three adults. The room we received is a tiny room room with two single beds and an incredibly uncomfortable extra bed - child size. After spending one night in this room, I cannot stress enough how outrageous it is. It would had been okay with me to at least have a room with two queen size beds if they cannot provide the triple room what I have paid for but the receptionist was incredibly unhelpful and said they didn’t even have the type of room I have paid for and refused to give any other room! This extra bed is absolutely not for an adult to sleep on.  If this wasn’t enough, the so called view is the neighboring building and kindergarten.  I have spent USD900 for this and I am absolutely disgusted and disappointed. I have paid for the room in advance and they refused to reimburse me so now I either spend a another couple hundred dollars for another room or someone in our company will not sleep for another six days.  Please stay away from this establishment, they completely messed up our vacation and definitely do not deserve even two stars. Ivett K wrote a review Oct 2018\n",
      "40 Not Bad Very modern decor, just across street from beach. Depending what side of the building your room, will either enhance or detract from the value. Rooms themselves are decent, unless you book the junior suite beach front... immaculate! Staff very friendly and helpful; special thank you too Mhiw, May and the porter guys.  The breakfast was not too exciting, and rates can be slightly pricy, but main inconvenience is trying to get to property from Second Rd. Properties on both sides have access both from Beach Rd and Second Rd but will not allow non-residence to use them. This means, if you enter Mera Mare from Second Rd, you must go further down to another public road that connects Beach and Second... then walk back. Cosmopolitan507629 wrote a review Oct 2018\n",

      "20 Really Disappointing Stay Good location, room service, ordered meals and breakfast were the only real positive aspects of this hotel during our week long stay.    Rooms small but modern and well appointed, bathroom good, bed mattress was a rock and choice of 4 very firm pillows only, 2 tiny rubbish bins, had security safe but only sits on drawer - not secured, one outside chair only, air conditioning noisy and sea view is only 50% because of angle of hotel and finally you open onto the Hard Rock hotel and the noise especially mid afternoons and on a Saturday night make for no sleep. Rooms contained no hotel information or Pattaya information - terrible.  Front desk staff cannot speak English and so asking for help or information was totally frustrating and a total waste of time. After 3 days we asked another girl at the desk for help and she actually spoke good English, she had been there for all our previous enquiries and never said a word, are you kidding me.  We also asked for bigger room but no-one got back to us.  Restaurant staff and meals good, clean but napkins were like cardboard  Towels were a disgrace, very old and overused, both room and pool, went and brought our own.  Pool area was also disappointing with a small shallow pool, poolside loungers no squabs, large beds loungers very good (only 4 or 5).  Wifi continuously dropped out sometimes 3 times a day!!!!!!  Security guy simply spent the day on his phone and never really got up or checked anyone or anything. John C wrote a review Sep 2018\n",

      "20 No thank you, won’t back Now I am here at the Mera Mare. Booked for 1 night Garden twin room because of Saturday (on Saturday there is a party in nearby Hard Rock hotel so very noisy). Requested room in quiet part of the hotel (really garden view are more quiet). But got Sea view room just overlooking on the Hardrock party! I asked room that I have booked but was told it is unavailable. So it is around midnight and we are listening to boom-boom party.  Also story about twin beds. There were no kind no size available at booking services, but everyone knows that usually it is possible to make twin beds together. Not here! Beds and nightstand at strictly fixed to the floor and it is impossible to move them!  Than bed. Mattresses are cheap, beds are really narrow. As a bed of young pupil-girl in full-week religious school.  Also room is quite dirty. Dirty mirror, floor in bathroom, floor in the room. Photos are attached. It seems that armchair was pissed on.  Two lamps on the room are out of order: at the entry and at the balcony.  Rain-shower doesn’t work, only standard shower. Bath amenities are in long-term used bottles, not in individual packs.  Than pool. 1 meter depths. Yes, 100 cm. In the 4-5 star hotel. Sun beds are ok, yes, but swimming in 1-meter pool is obvious experience.  When we arrived nobody even tried to help us with luggage till I asked for bell-boy after check-in.  Really hotel makes appearance that guests are not so waited, room, pool-zone make feeling sad, staff is a bit angry and unserviceable.  Location is pretty ok but there is no direct access from the Second road.  Comparing it with Hard Rock hotel, Avani Pattaya, Amari Ocean and Mera Mare cannot be competitive with them being priced the same. Ingwartravel wrote a review Aug 2018\n",

      "40 Not bad We enjoyed our four-day stay at this hotel. But food prices were beyond ridiculous, so we ate out at local shops every day. $20 USD is just too much for breakfast.    The hotel pool is secluded, but very small. Fortunately, it was never crowded. The exercise room was not cooled well, and was also quite small.    Our room was nice: great shower and tub. Nice bed and small balcony, though it needed two chairs so we could both sit out and enjoy the sunset over the water. stepeg B wrote a review Jul 2018\n",

Bathroom was ok however toilet was awful,had to hold it for around 10 seconds to flush. You could here everything in the corridor from the room also there ajoining doors to next room which you can here everything from their room. Tv channels are basic..no music channel,and the pool was terrible,1meter deep all the way down just doesnt make sense. I do feel it wouldn't take much to get this hotel upto the standard they claim they are,as all my points are minor however when paying 3000bht pn i expected more.

      "40 Nice, Decent Hotel on Beach Road Luxurious hotel on the beach Road, right beside the Hard Rock Hotel. The rooms here have semi sea views. It is 9 - storey high building, the front part of which houses restaurants and cafe on the ground floor and swimming pool / gym on the first floor. The pool is relaxing with loungers all over. No food or drinks are allowed near the pool. The water is clean and well maintained.  The house-keeping staffs are okayish and not very particular about their work. The rooms are well-equipped and there are many amenities added to the rooms. They are well lit too.  The washrooms are spacious and have bath tubs as well as a shower space. You can get a tremendous view of the Hard Rock Hotel and its pool if you are on that side of the hotel, not sure about the view from the other side. Food quality is also above expectations. The breakfast spread is too good. Having different types of breads and omelettes give a great start to the day. Breakfasts start at 6 in the morning. Staff is courteous and it is also a guest friendly hotel. Prateek Agarwal wrote a review Jun 2018\n",

Arrived at the hotel, lazy guard almost didn’t care to help with luggage.    Came to front desk and the staff seemed pretty untrained. Gave us first a room, but after waiting 15 min they gave us another. Room wasn’t ready.    Everyday front desk staff was not paying attention saying hi/hello, no smiling. Pretty un personal stay. Did not feel welcome.    The room we stayed in was very small and not to mention the bathroom.    The hotel is very clean, the food in the restaurant was ok but again staff here looked like they hated their job. And it is also well overpriced.    Tv, lots of channels not working properly, called front desk, some technicians came but just smiled and changed a cable. Did not help with the signal issue. They said all rooms have the same issue..    The photos of the hotel on websites are pretty overdimentioned. Swimming pool is much smaller then it looks like on the photos!

In the room there is zero storage space. There is a little tiny wardrobe, however your bags will be on the floor in the corner. Nowhere to lay clothes, socks etc unless you are keeping them in your bag. There is only space to hang up a few things which was quite a pain to be honest.    We also had problems with the lift every time we got in for some reason. Either it wouldnt go down when we pressed the button, went to the wrong floor, or just didnt move!!!    Taking nothing away from it though it was a plesent stay, maybe a little expensive for the experience however. Lindsay M wrote a review Apr 2018\n",

      "30 Opulence in a world of poor impractical hotel design A hotel that tries but fails to be a high end destination. I have spent many holidays in Pattaya and this was the most expensive hotel I've stayed at in those vists. The positives of the beach fron setting, the oppulence of the totally under used and oversized lobby the freshness of the well appointed rooms and public areas is totally lost by two key factors in any Pattaya vacation. The breakfast offer was average at best but the swimming pool size and particularly impractical layout is a total disaster. A complete lack of space, shade and quiet areas to relax. For the price paid there are many lower star hotels that will provide a better overal holiday base. I would not return here as the need for a good pool area in Pattaya is a critical factor in any choice of hotel. Very opulent but missing a critical element, a decent accessible swimming pool!

      "40 A bundle of joy! Situated right next to the Hard Rock Hotel on the Pattaya Beach Road, Mera Mare was a great find! Since it's a relatively new establishment, the infrastructure and maintenance was A class. In fact, our room on the 7th floor was totally love at first sight! I for one, am a sucker for anything with a cosy, laidback vibe rather than a jazzy vain opulence, and the room fit the bill just right! Additionally the beach facing balcony was an icing on the cake. I mean, who wouldn't enjoy a sundowner drink watching the sunset right from your room! The service and hospitality was commendable too.  The only downer for us was the breakfast. Reason being, it primarily catered to people who would enjoy a Thai and Asian cuisine. We, would have preferred more continental options. That apart, it's an excellent choice with everything in close vicinity. Nonetheless, distant from the noise and extreme hustle bustle. Highly recommended for couples! :) Shreya P wrote a review Feb 2018\n",

Service was helpful but not what is expected from a hotel priced at this level and with no privileges from being a Gold member.  However, if I had booked this hotel through Booking.com or a similar web portal, I'm sure my expectations would have been less than what I have come to expect through Accor. A lesson learned and a big disappointment at being over charged. I will have to think again about my membership.  One further negative point, was that there was no warning about the loud music and partying from the Hard Rock Hotel next door. paulrU1393VQ wrote a review Sep 2017\n",

      "40 A nice journey in Pattaya A nice location. However, the entrance of the hotel is quite hidden. The taxi driver don't know the location of the hotel. Every time when you are taking the tuk tuk car, You have to stop as you see the hard rock hotel. The room price is quite reasonable. The staff there are all quite nice. My husband is a chef, he is quite satisfied with the hotel breakfast. The quality of food is good, but not many options of food is provided. I specially recommend the Benedict eggs n the pancakes. The bath tub in the bathroom is huge. We will come again in our next trip. The hotel is quite suitable for couples but not for family with kids. The swimming pool is too small and shallow. It is not close to the nice massage shop， you have to take at least twenty minutes walk to a nice massage shop！The bakery shop on the ground floor , it serves good cakes n coffee. You won't feel regard for a stay there. cheriecsy wrote a review Aug 2017\n",

      "50 Execellent Experience and Great Room I had a short stay over in the city. The hotel décor is very modern. The breakfast exceeds my expectation with this budget. People is friendly and nice. It is a small and cute hotel. I had stayed in the neighbor hotel(not to give a name) before in the same area. And I have to say it is 10 times better than the other. lonelycat2017 wrote a review Jul 2017\n",

      "50 Mera Mare Hotel Great location on the beach with 40 baht sunbeds and plenty of things to see. Very polite and attentive staff. Pool a bit shallow but the sunbeds are the best seen. Plenty to eat nearby and being on the beach side is away from the bars. Near to Central Plaza, Mikes Plaza and and a 20baht Songtheuw to Walking Street if thats your thing. Or go to next street back for even more bars. peterw9999 wrote a review Jun 2017\n",

It's right by the beach and many restaurants at front street.    It's also good for \"men vacation\" as there lot of pretty walking by the beach that could see many walking by right there u could just swing and pick up and bring to your room.

It was late when we checked in and the card machine to guarantee payment didn't work, in fact it took me around 15mins to check out in the morning due to this issue. Room was ok with a sea view. Breakfast was good. One issue was the toiletries, I forgot mine and wanted a shave but they do not provide johnquarmby wrote a review May 2017\n"

Checked in 10 hours late at 22:00 hrs and check in was carried out efficiently before showing us to our well appointed room. Breakfast was a Buffet and had a wide choice of food they also had an egg station who catered for our individual needs, the staff were always on hand to assist and bring my many morning Latte's. Housekeeping were always flexible for room cleaning and again very helpful.. Room had a comfortable bed, TV either many English Channels and a effective air-conditioning system. After a few days the staff became to know us and were always on hand to help.. A special thanks to the manager \"Est\" who was always on hand and made his self known to us to ensure our stay was perfect. It was our 44th Wedding Anniversary whilst there and Est and his time ensured we enjoyed our evening with a cake, wine and a lovely bouquet of flowers. Swimming pool was more than adequate and comfortable sun loungers. Many thanks to all at the hotel who made our stay memorable and I look forward to celebrate my 45h weeding anniversary in their company 178KennyQ wrote a review Apr 2017\n",

It is located in great location, opposite to the beach, 3 mins walk to Central Pattaya, plenty of shops and restaurants nearby, friendly stuffs, lovely cozy room with decent facilities.    Here comes a few flaws which I wish the hotel will fix to improve itself from nice to excellent hotel;    - my room was overly filled with perfume.    - breakfast buffet is just edible.

It's right near the beach and a short walk (or 10 baht songthao) to central festival shopping centre (must go, just for the amazing food court).    Some taxi's aren't familiar with Mera Mare, but you can simply explain that it's next to the Hard Rock hotel.    Get the breakfast option .

      "40 Beautiful hotel Mera Mare is beautiful, stylish and well located hotel with super friendly and helpful staff. We stayed there in 10 days, from 29. Dec – 8. Jan. Breakfast was very good with lot of choices, both European and Asian food. The room was nice and clean, bed comfortable and good pillows. Coffee maker and little minibar is in the room and you get 2 bottles of free water everyday. Nice swimmingpool is on the 2nd floor and there is also gym.    The only nagging thing is the room doors. Totally intolerable. All the hotel is very well decorated with very nice furnitures ect. but the room doors are cheap junks. Very, very annoying all this slamming and echos. Only little door-break on every door and a little carpet on corridors will fix everything! KatrinArena wrote a review Feb 2017\n",

      "40 Little treasure on Pattaya beach I booked this hotel after seeing other reviews out here and I'm happy to say it's exactly as described. Its a new property right across the beach very very conveniently located. Rooms are spacious with balcony and bathroom tub is so huge. Decor is beautiful and has an amazing view. Since its in the heart of Pattaya, alcazar show, central Pattaya mall, Pattaya night market at withing 1 km, which u can easily walk. Hotel service is good. Breakfast is totally American with no veg options. But the chef is good and he prepared veg noodles and stir fry veggies for us for all 3 days of our stay. Overall, I'm happy with the service, room and special mention for location. There are very few hotels which are so conveniently located. Totally recommend. sweetkiran wrote a review Jan 2017\n",
      "50 OUTSTANDING Having stayed with your hotel chain many times before and this time I travelled alone as I was attending a medical check up at the Pattaya International Hospital. And fell upon your hotel by accident only to find out that your property had not fully opened but you were prepared to have me as a pre opening guest which I gladly accepted.From the very time of my arrival to my departure words simply fail me... The ambience, service , style and comfort of the accommodation and your outstanding staff made my stay most enjoyable. Your team could not have done enough for me your senior management headed by the Hotel manager and his outstanding assistant Khun Egg. Having been a tour operator for over forty years I have stayed in many properties worldwide, I would rate your Hotel a full ten out of ten. The very location can not be beaten direct overlooking the bay of Pattaya and so convenient to all the shopping centres, restaurants and night time activities all with in a short walk from your property. You took a huge risk in having me stay at your property prior to the official open but guys you really pulled out the boat and gave me one of the best stays ever. To your general manager Khun Maud and the owners I wish them every success for 2016 and many years to come...    Con Murphy , Dublin Ireland Con M wrote a review Jan 2017\n"

      "30 Room for improvement We stayed at this hotel for five nights in January 2017.  It is a modern design and looks good. Practicality in some aspects of the room design is lacking.    The hotel was chosen after careful consideration of all the options available and it came highly recommended.  Staff were attentive and the door person was excellent and \"leapt\" forward anytime we had luggage or to open the door for us. Our main criticism here however would be the absence of any noticeable security as we drove into the underground car park and found we apparently had lift access directly to all floors in the hotel from the basement. Reception were unaware of our arrival and we had to bring our heavy luggage up to reception in the elevator.  There is also no obvious reception area on arrival at the hotel as the only other entrance is placed far back and only accessible after mounting some stairs and taking a fairly long walk up to the building itself. Again, no noticeable signage or outside reception staff to greet us. There is only one small parking space for set-down and pick up at the front. Our driver had do drive out of the space to enable us to open the doors of his vehicle when we left.    We took two different rooms during our stay, one for ourselves and one for family. The rooms were similar but there were some odd design differences. Our bathroom door opened inward and prevented access to the shower unless the door was completely closed. In the other room, this was not the case, but the room refridgerator was mounted in a recess inside the bathroom. Other issues were, the shower fittings had dual outlets however the overhead one just did not work. Room lighting could also be improved, as we had no dedicated light over our tea and coffee making facilities, necessitating the use of a hand held torch on occasion. We also felt that a larger dressing mirror would really be of help, there was only a small mirror in the bathroom. Little things were seemingly overlooked like there being no liners in either of the two small bins provided for small items of household refuse. Oddly, although there were bedside dressers a cabinet and a luggage rest, there were no drawers in any of them. Only one small drawer was available inside the single wardrobe. This is just not enough space.    Overall our rooms were comfortable, although noise from the outside corridor was very noticeable at times. Nick C wrote a review Jan 2017\n",
      "40 Nice New Hotel Stayed here for 10 nights over the new year period with family. Stayed in many hotels in the area, and this is certainly one of the much better ones giving it has been recently built.    Like most places, it has its teething issues, especially with staffing, but in general a very good stay and would return again.    Location 5/5 - ideal location right on beach road, across from beach and within a few mins walk of central shopping mall. Easy access to mini taxi.    Room 4/5 - rooms are set back and at side of hotel, so there is no noise from road or bars. However the internal walls are a little thin, can hear people turning on switches etc. Thankfully most of them time we had no neighbours.    Facilities - 4/5 - small pool and gym on 2nd floor. Ideal, however limited seating space, especially during day    Breakfast / Food 4/5 - good selection of Thai and European items and taste very nice. Young chef makes a nice eggs benedict. However most of food in hot plates is like warm at best, as they leave lids open and have the freezing cold air on blowing across the area.    Staff 3/5 - majority of staff are friendly, but several of the waitresses at breakfast, really are unfriendly. Never a politely hello or welcome, never smile or say anything when they come will ordered coffee or food.    Note - hotel is part of Accor group, which is not noted on their website. Had I realised, I would have booked direct with corporate discount code, for cheaper rate and to collect reward points, rather than using Agoda. Paul S wrote a review Jan 2017\n",

      "50 Fantastic Loved this hotel.    We came here before heading down to Hua Hin to get married, couldn't have asked for anything better.    Room was great, a little small with an extra bed in for our little one but that was fine.    Staff were amazing, so very friendly.    Rooms cleaned everyday.    Location was great.    Breakfast was okay, if we were Asian it would have been brilliant there was hardly no western food, that was fine as there was still plenty of fruit and pastries to choose from.    We really enjoyed the pool as there was never anybody there it was so quiet, we are around the pool a few times too and that was really good.    Only niggly thing is the room doors, they don't have a soft close and the walls seem quite thin so when other guest close their doors it sounds very loud an was waking us up constantly.    Other than that we had a great stay and would definatley come back. Tamlyn R wrote a review Nov 2016\n",
      "30 Good location but noisy room Despite its good location close to the department store, walls of a guest room are not at all sound proof that makes it very hard to sleep. Moreover, there is no cushion over a door that makes it very noisy when guests open and close the door. In terms of breakfast, continental breakfast is less-than-stellar but acceptable. amornrata59 wrote a review Oct 2016\n",

      "40 Spent 7 days at this hotel and very happy with service and amenities Hard to fault the Mera Mare hotel and the only negatives I could find would be:  1: Some nights music from the Hard Rock hotel can be quite intrusive (room on that side with lovely ocean view)  2: The water in the shower would change quite rapidly between hot and cold for no apparent reason  3: The pool is VERY shallow (up to my waist at both ends)  4: Some staff have fairly poor English but that is fairly common in Pattaya  Apart from that the facilities are lovely, the staff are very friendly and helpful, the location perfect, the room was gorgeous and always kept spotless, the food top notch.  At around $175AU per night it is not a cheap place to stay but well worth it if you want to spoil yourself.  Highly recommended! Ellis G wrote a review Aug 2016\n",

      "50 A beautiful new modern hotel in Pattaya Mera Mara exceeded expectations & is on the beach with exceptional sea views. I'm a frequent world traveler and have only compliments for Mera Mara its restaurant & staff. While new and frankly lavishly appointed...Mera Mara is a bargain. Th s hotel is Thai owned and staffed. The Thai staff is exceptionally welcoming and attentive and in a lovely Thai way they don't hover but seem to magically anticipate their guests needs or requests.    The location could not be better in Pattaya. Nearly midway along Pattaya Beach slightly north of the midpoint of the long crescent stretch of sand. The location offers great views and allows easy access to all of Pattaya's attractions while providing guests a quiet and serene oasis in the middle of the madness that is Pattaya. The hotel is on the beach and so offers unobstructed views of the beach & city in all directions.    Mera Mara's two restaurants: Octopus bet Sky & Pastry Addiction are world class, definitely not your standard hotel fare. The breakfast buffet is superb and features a large high quality selection of Asian & Western dishes. Outside of breakfast Mera Mare's chefs could go be any good fusion & gastro pubs in San Francisco real competition but at a fraction of the price.    The room was very reasonably priced with breakfast at $96/night for a King room with a balcony and full sea view. The bathroom was spectacular featuring white carrerra and black gold veined marbles. Fixtures were high quality. The tub was large and had a glass wall with privacy shade that when raised provided a partial sea view. Water was plentiful and the pressure was perfect. Ample hotel branded bottled drinking water was provided and as much extra as required free upon request. The lavatories in the common areas are like something out of a movie.    The bars stock an excellent selection of fine wines at reasonable prices as well as beer and spirits. Drinks are mixed perfectly and are generous for the price.    All in all Mera Mara sets the new standard for modern luxury in Pattaya on beach road.    Finally a special thanks to the staff especially Mr. Jo & Kitty who helped us during our stay. Mr. Jo in particular went above and beyond for us. For some reason we were unable to book our room through their website as my credit card and bank kept rejecting my security credentials. This was very stressful as our stay coincided with a popular 5 day Thai holiday and many of the best locations in Pattaya were fully booked. However when we called the hotel Mr. Jo told us not to worry and would reserve our room for our arrival date. He even called us to confirm as we traveled from Koh Chang amid the heavy holiday traffic.    Thanks Mera Mare for a great stay!!! See you again. :-) Quai_Noi wrote a review Jul 2016\n",

Within walking distance are local shops, beach across the road, local and international restaurants as well as the main shopping plaza.  The hotel staff could not have been more helpful or courteous, even to the point of opening all doors for you. I travelled with my elderly mother and when requesting assistance the staff were extremely accommodating. The hotel rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable with views of the ocean.

      "50 Great Hotel next to the Beach We booked our stay via Agoda. Not sure if this is brand new or under new management. The rooms looked great, the price was great, but there were no reviews of the property. Normally, we like to read what other travelers wrote, but we took a chance. The gamble paid off. Not sure if it is new or not, but they were doing construction still. Check in was easy and we received a welcome drink and cold towel. The room (deluxe) was very well decorated and a good size. The only thing that was odd in the room was that there was a long marble structure (desk was my guess), but no chair. That was quickly taken care of when they brought be one. The only down side of the room/hotel is that you had to sign in via browser and limited to 2 devices for the internet, but the speeds were good. The breakfast was great. A big selection for a small hotel. 7-8 hot dishes, an egg station, all your pastries, juices, fruits...The location was across the street from the beach, a 5 minute walk to Central Festival, and 15 mins walk to Walking St. or a quick ride on a tuk tuk (10 baht per person).

      "50 Amazing Guest House Stay here two times this year over 30 days. The rooms are very big and in a new condition. With great bed and sofas. The standard of the rooms are 10 out of 10. Make other hotel look old. Only thing need to make it perfect is new furniture on the balcony and a water boiler. Staff and manager are amazing so is safety. Bar downstairs is very very good with two pool tables. If you want a swimming pool only 200THB at Nature View hotel 5 min walk. Jesper_Swahn wrote a review Dec 2018\n",
      "50 fabulous guesthouse. The room I stayed is large with fan and aircon, Perfect for sleeping. Staff very helpful , If I had to pick a fault it would be shower is a little small, but this is a minor detail. Garden guest house is in excellent location, close to nightlife . 8neil64 wrote a review Jul 2018\n",
      "30 Big Clean room - excellent location 42sqm is bigger than a lot of Condos. With a sofa and 2 table and chairs a spacious room by any standards. Bed was big and comfy not too firm. I liked the ceiling fan with the air con, it gets the room cooler so much quicker. The bathroom was on the small side with only just enough room for us larger guys. Shower was warm but nothing great. Small balcony with table and chairs for the smokers.  My only small gripes were the bed only had a sheet and not a quilt, and no coffee facilities in the room. We were on the top floor but could still hear some bar music until about 2am, with the TV on you could hear nothing outside.    Its in a great location in a small street just off Soi Buakhao, everything just a short walk away or hop on the regular baht buses at the end of the street. Its in a very competitive area for B&B's but its good value compared with nearby hotels. We payed 1150baht a night in peak season for the larger deluxe room. Staff were polite and friendly with good english. We enjoyed our stay. Bkkmegabob wrote a review Jan 2017\n",
      "50 I WILL REGRET MY POSTING THIS REVEIW I JUST KNOW IT First I should explain the title , I have discovered a true gem of a guest house here the selfish me say's keep it quiet tell nobody but the other me says that the owner of this Guest house and Bar below should be applauded for creating a fantastic place in everyway in a city built on second rate rooms and accepting that second rate is the norm. I should explain I come to Bangkok and Pattaya from Hong Kong every 6/8 weeks on Biz on have over the years found a few acceptable places to stay , it was pure luck that I stumbled across this place taking a short cut between soi Buakhao and the Avenue Mall it sits in a mews style area really well kept street with a few other guest house and restaurant so out of place no soi dogs just felt peaceful I stop in the bar for a coffee started chatting with the Manager and the extremely relaxed in a professional way not lazy way I just felt comfortable , I just ask about there rooms out of curiosity as I had already checked in and paid in full in a well know large 3 star hotel Well they only had one room to show its there standard room 1000Bht a day to say I was impressed is an understatement so much so I had checked out my already paid room and moved in the room shown me within 30 mins..  The room is very spacious with a king size bed and a real mattress good quality linen it has two good quality modern sofas not that cheap plastic seating normally offered a coffee table good lighting both bedside and overhead very modern Scandinavian style fittings a writing desk with well placed power outlets everywhere a separate area with a 42inch Sony LCD TV with cable and I joke not it is immaculate the owner aw Belgian I have not met as yet has really designed the space well, not the usual generic rubbish thrown in a space . from the main area you walk through a dressing area with lots of well placed shelf's and a hanging area that accommodates my suits and shirts on a full set of good quality matching hangers, which then follows through to a bathroom that has a great shower and enough tissue and bits to keep even the most demanding guest happy and very good quality bath sheets and i should state i have been told they have even better rooms for a Bargain 1,150bht    So do I hear sounds to good to be true well I do hope you feel that way and not come and see for yourself that way I may be able to get my future booking here , but I feel when the word gets out , it will be easier to find a law abiding member of staff at station 9 beach rd.  I will end this review with a review of the bar below that also is immaculate staffed by extreme efficient ladies all well dressed with a great personal way about them they alone are so rare in Pattaya I have no idea where he found these attentive friendly ladies and you ready for this not a cell phone in sight I was in shock .  oh yes there are two good quality pool tables with a full compliment of cues , the music played are standards and not so loud you are unable to hear a conversation the seats are comfortable both at the bar areas and the terrace and for me if It could not get any better they actually have a choice of good wines at a very reasonable 80bht , I Have no idea how the owner has achieved such overall quality and service at incredible value for money , but I will start when I do meet him , by congratulating him on creating a real gem followed shortly by me block booking a room .  Really please come see for yourself , and No I do not own a share in the place I wish I did., Enjoy rv20152015 wrote a review Feb 2016\n"

      "50 Great hostel, amazing staff and close to beach and everything! Thank you so much to all 3 of you at True Hostel, you really go above and beyond to help your guests. This was my second time back here, my first time was solo and I stayed in dorm room where I met other travelers. This time when I came back to Pattaya with a friend I knew I wanted to stay here again because they were so nice and helpful before. They let us stay there the day until evening when we were leaving late and stored our bags. They washed our laundry and hung and folded it for us for just 40 Baht and it was a lot of laundry. Very nice place, I wish you all the best!  Grace & Chris graceromaynebodo wrote a review Jul 2016\n",
      "40 Amazing hostel with friendly staff for a good price I stayed for one week at this hostel. The reason that i booked it was because it is the cheapest hostel around Jomtien. Because of the price I didn't expect to much to be honest.    When I arrived I was much later then expected because of some problems with the mini van I had from Bangkok. I was really tired and done with the traveling but the moment I stepped in I felt welcome. They gave me some water and a refreshing towel. Then they showed me the room and I was surprised. It is a small room with 3 bunk beds but it was really clean. You share the room with 6 people and in the room there is a bathroom. There is also a balcony and on the balcony there were lockers.    The owner is Vietnamese/American and is a very happy and helpful man. Also the 2 ladies who week here where really friendly. The explained to me how the baht busses worked because that is the cheapest way around Pattaya. At one point I really needed to do my laundry and I asked where I could do it. They immediately said 'just give it to us and we wash it for you'. I thought that was really friendly of them.  Overall I had a great stay here because of the friendly staff and the clean rooms. tessatravelss wrote a review Jul 2016\n",
      "50 Perfect stay! Perfect location (3 min from the beach), clean and funny environment (they clean all the rooms every single day and refill the fridge with water!!)! Very thoughtful staff! They will take care of you and you can enjoy every moment spent with them! The wifi works perfectly and it is free!  This is a safe area and full of facilities! Excellent value for money! I highly recommend this hostel!!! Mario S wrote a review Jun 2016\n",
      "50 Great Stay!! My girlfriend and I stayed here for two nights and had a brilliant experience.  The owner is Vietnamese/American and is a very happy and helpful man. He put on a film for us on a big screen TV and also helped us out with directions and things to see/do.  The location is 30 seconds from the beach front, where you can get a baht bus to Pattaya for only 10 baht.  There are many restaurants on the same street as the hostel.  The rooms are cleaned each day and are spacious and well maintained.  Definitely stay here if you are staying in Jomtien!! JacobLovatt wrote a review Jun 2016\n",
      "40 Was a really adventure The True hostel is a really nice place to host if you like to enjoy with local people, because there a lot girls very friendly and with a lot energy. I was there on Saturday night and the party was there, drinking and dancing in the reception bar. I choose the cheapest host in Jomtien and was really enjoyable and animated.

      "10 Only location is good, everything else is bad ! Only location is good, everything else is bad ! They just want your money and don't care that you have a pleasant stay. Nothing is enjoyable, and cannot even lay at the pool ! No real car park, and your can will burn under the sun. I will never stay there again ! By the way, the management do not care your problems and reviews. MobileReviewsEm wrote a review Sep 2020\n",
      "20 Poorly maintained hotel. Good location, close to the beach.  We’ve had one double bed and one single bed in the room and it is standard for deluxe sea-view rooms. Rooms were spacious.  The hotel staff were mostly friendly and helpful without any extra charges.  Internet was also good throughout the hotel.  The breakfast was poor and cold, the only plus was that they fried eggs on both sides when asked about it and the eggs were then hot.  The fitness room was closed/not available and the pool needed proper cleaning.  There were only 4 sun-beds without a mattresses, and they were in poor condition, - almost falling apart. On the other side, poolside towels were available free of charge. We missed proper sun-beds with mattress and parasol, but the beach was right by and there you could rent proper sun-beds with a mattress and a parasol.  There was one very annoying moment: In the corridor in the 8th floor there was a stationary phone. This phone was ringing at night and at 7am every morning but nobody picked it up. So if you want to wake up at 7am each morning while on vacation, this is the hotel for you!  The hotel is old and worn and seems to have poor maintenance. Pathfinder746827 wrote a review Jan 2019\n",
      "10 Not worth the money they charge Property is at prime location however, needs to buy good towel and sheets. It's has list of do's n don't. Everything is chargeable. We asked for additional towel as one in room was torn literally \"torn\" they said it will be charged. Big language issue. Kids 5 and above are charged for breakfast and breakfast area is dirty, not much choice of food. It had a bad smell as if it needs major cleaning. Asked for an additional tea bag which she said will be charged, felt like they want to charge for everything. Bathroom is not clean. Once you take shower water stays there and is everywhere. May be it's with that room..others not sure. Room had a great view however, to close to main road so noisy. Debalina DG wrote a review Jan 2018\n",
      "40 Good alround hotel Move here from the hotel opposite (see report on The Pat) Same price room, bigger, better,BUT the room I was in did need a repaint, there was stains running down the wall from water ingress, apart from that, very well equiped, 2 good sized beds, kettle, tea/coffee facility, good view of the beach from the front line balcony, noise free, the pool was on the 4th floor, good access, breakfast included it the price, no problem taking guests back overnight, good efficient and pleasant staff, again a little expensive, maybe 1000bht per night. shower good, but leaked a bit overe the floor, no hand towel and bath towels old, other than that good. Good access to hotel. I booked this room for 3 days, made a mistake, as I did not realise the flight times, and was given a refund no problems, when asked. Would use this again.

Room was OK, simple but clean. Wifi very hit and miss. Didn't have the bath that the description promised. Restaurant was only ever open for breakfast and not for lunch and dinner as advertised. To be honest I wouldn't have used it anyway as the breakfast was inedible and looked like it had been out since the day before. Staff refused to let me pay by credit card and were very rude. Way below the standard of every other 4 star hotel I have stayed in when I have been to Thailand. YouAreMyForest wrote a review Sep 2018\n"

      "50 Great Place for stay & Comfortable room with affordable prices in Pattaya We stay their for Business only for 1 night. We love the room due to the size of the room very comfortable & clean compare with the rate what we pay. Breakfast also offer delicious Thai food.    The location of the hotel it just 100 meters away from beach. we can see a seaview from our Terrace.    We're strongly recommended for People who love to stay in quite beach Ploy Nalin P wrote a review Nov 2018\n",
      "30 all that glitters is not gold The Hotel looks new and it really is. The rooms are big and it is close to the beach. the roof top pool area is nice. BUT all that glitters is not gold!    The rooms had been renovates just before our arriving. Everywhere you could see splashes of colours on the floor. The drinking glasses had been totaly dirty. Hairs on the Floor. Still feces on the toilet. The outside of the closet was dirty.    But the really worst was the bath room. They missed to install a ventilation! ... so there is a wet room without any ventilation. You can imagine how it smells all the time? > disgusting! the solution of the staff is to keep the door of the bath open with a trashcan. So the smell is now in the whole room. Now the bath was new renovated but for sure in a few moth it will be full of mold because of that missing ventilation. And please don´t take a room tith a bathtub. if you take a shower lot of the water is running on the florr so that the whole bath is wet. every time you enter the bath after shower you have to walk through water.    The Roof top pool is nice and has a great view but lot of the pads of sunbeds ar torn ripped. Also there are no towels or drink offers at the pool area.    Finally i would say Rooms and Hotel look nice at firt view but they are bad maintanced and have for sure a big problem with cleaning, and the bath rooms are horrible.    + big rooms  + new Hotel  + close to the beach  + nice roof top pool with great view    - dirty rooms  - disgusting smell of bath rooms because of missing Ventilation  - some bathrooms are totally wet after taking a shower  - torn pads of sun beds  - 50% of the rooms have in 2 meters distance behind the window a big wall  - sometimes very noisy and dreadful karaoke in the Hotel Bar apallage wrote a review Feb 2018\n",
      "30 Just ok A nice hotel with big roms. Big bathrooms and chower. We had a rom with balcony in front to street. We upgrated to this because cheaper room is with balcony to next building 1 m away, backside. Completly no vue. Brekfast was ok, you will survive, but not spesial tasty. Internett conection is crap. (im a internett man) If this hotel is fullbooked, noone will get on internett. The line is way to small for everyone. Pool area is on 6th floor. Nice vue to ocean, but it fits ony 50% of all costimurs if hotel is full booked. Pool is 5m long, 3 m wide and 1,70m deep, thats it. Location is good. Soi 12 is a litelbit away from the biggest crowded places. But 10B and you take bathtaxi to the more cowded places (soi 1-7)Its have a bar just acros the street, so cheap beer is no problem. (50%of compare to hotel) 100m from beach, perfect. They clean everyday so no problem. Compair to price (200euro a week) is a good chois. Ole Kristian B wrote a review Nov 2017\n",
      "10 Short break from the city Me and my family decided to go to jontiem beach for a short break away from Bangkok last weekend staying at inn Redidence service apartments.  Our experience wasn't very good as they have many upgrades going on and the noice was horrendous even they posted times where there would be noise but wasn't adhered too as they were told to do work quicker, they put us in a room directly next door to the work so it was even louder, not suited for any disabled people as they provide a bath wit an in shower but gave a shower glass that restricts disabled people and the bath sits in a base with a 8\" inch edge round the bath.  Having a broken leg it was hard for me to shower or take a bath and in result could only take a sink wash.  I certainly wouldn't recommend going there in the next 6 months or look to see if there is any building work ongoing, and also if traveling with a disabled person make sure you can get a room with a shower only if they have.

      "40 This place was quite new and very well arranged This place was quite new and very well arranged. The room we stayed was very large with two large single bed, large sofa and large LED TV screen. Each room having own balcony where people who stays near the street can have or enjoy the morning or afternoon street and sea view (Too bad that my room situated on the other side so all I could see was another close-look building)  The bathroom having large window where you can see the bedroom (lucky enough that they had screen provided) Fair amenities provided.  We stayed only one night so haven't got time to check the Pool and Restaurant.  All rooms including lobby area are provided with free wifi internet.  It takes only 2 minutes walk to reach the beach.

      "50 Nice place Good living,clean rooms,roof top pool not much view from de luxe Room,better in grand de luxe=Street view.Quiet at least room 502.Really helpful staff, upgrade when I book wrong,preciate that.I recommend JoJo restaurant just outside door,great breakfast and dinner. beach chair owner just cross the road,have great service use eat lunch there.Great service on both places,i plan stay 1 day but in end it was 4 days.will come back.

      "40 Weekend at Pattaya Is a small hotel or more motel as in US you park your car in front of your room in a quiet area.  To stay there you must have a car or motocycle is not in center city close to restaurant and shop, is the price to pay to avoid the nightlife noise.  The rooms are large with a surprising decoration, we were in Morocco one. the only small black dot is the international breakfast, is not looking very appaitissant but we did not try it. BkkEric wrote a review Jun 2015\n",
      "20 Rooms in poor condition, far from all the real action { note: We are a couple (M43, F38), adventurous and thrifty travellers, with moderate and realistic expectations of the accommodations we book }    Sure, we know this is a Love Hotel 24hrs, but in Thailand, those hotels can be either very nice or not so nice. Sweet Love inn is advertised as very nice one.    Front desk service was sub-par, and the lady pushed for a tip on top of that. Breakfast in the morning was the cheapest you can get in Thailand (hotdog sausages, white toast, cold fried egg).    We saw 5 rooms and ended up selecting one. We soon realized that half of the lights didn't work (many were burnt, and a complete wall light setup didn't work because it was broken). Fortunately they were able to fix half of the non working lights while we went out for dinner. The room was spacious, so it had that going for it.    Location is way outside of Pattaya's main interest. We had a motorbike, so that was fine. Still, I would not recommend this Love Hotel. There are plenty more in the heart of the action in Pattaya, at reasonable price, with much better rooms and service.    Wifi was blazing fast. Martin P wrote a review Apr 2015\n",
      "40 Very far from all action and Jomtien beach Stayed there 1 night in room104. THB 700 for 1 night including breakfast (never had breakfast so don't know how was the quality).    I have my own car so no problem commuting but for travelers it can be a nightmare.    As others have mentioned before - no one speaks any English here.    Rooms are big and so is bathroom but price is too high for location. bkk_49311 wrote a review Apr 2014\n"

      "20 Difficult to find. Impossible to forget We spent one night in this place.  Our choice was based on several yardsticks : possibility of settling with pets, availability of rooms (it was Thai national holiday and in vast majority of hotels all rooms had already been booked) and the closest location to our next destination.  Quite frankly, according to our aims, Siam Wave fully satisfiied us.  The same time, if someone asked me: \"would you recommend this place for one night standing?\", I would replied: \"No\".  There are few reasons of my negative response.  Firstly, despite on good location, it was really difficult to find this hostel. There was a nameboard along the main road: \"Siam Wave 20 m. Left\". The \"left\" turned out to be a hidden small path. It was really easy to miss this path, especially if you ride a car.  The next disadvantage is abscence of hospitality. By the way, russian nation was always associated with hospitality. I mentioned this because the owners of this place are russians.  In reality, gate were opened but nobody had met us when we came. After calling for a number mentioned on the \"booking.com\", the owner appeared. Appeared and with words \"price is 500 baht, check out before the 11 a.m\" - disappeared. We never seen him again.  Now, I'd like to mention some remarks concerning the room. Our first impression about it was \"the old grandfather's house\". In Russia there is the word the best describe such kind of houses: \"dacha\". The interesting fact is that owners are positioned their hostel as a \"dacha\". If they meant the old grandfather's house, they were really close to desired association.  So, inside of the room (including the bathroom) were awful stuffy smell. All of the furniture are old. Kitchen accessorises are filthy. The bathroom door was broken. Sanitary engineering were also broken. Bed linen was with spots. Finally, the floor was dirty.  As a result, we were sleeping in our clothes, going inside of the room in our shoes and eating in a at the street cafes. We were happy that we had to spend only one night there.  Of course, when we were leaving this place nobody saw us off. But it wasn't important anymore.  Yes, while I was writting I remembered two more positive moments which are needed to be pointed out. The first one is a good free Wi-Fi (but we had to call to owner to get the password). The second benefit is a quite low price per one night: 500 bah. But I really think that bad service can't be justified with a low price.  Walking around the territory, we suggested that owners are living on the third floor and sell for rent the first floor and the second one. We came up with this idea because on the third floor only was the grating (sure, self-security is much more important than security of guests)  In any case, we shoukd bear in mind that hospitality and quality are the base of such kind of service. In this particular occasion such kind of behaviour is proved the stereotype about russians, that their only aim is making money and that's it.  It is a fact that each of us can choose the service he prefers. As for us, we are not accepted  such kind of service even for free.  Enjoy your rest. ConquerorOfSummits wrote a review Jul 2017\n"

      "50 Just as good second time around Our recent trip to Jomtien was our second. The first time we visited we found this restaurant very close to our hotel. The seafood dishes are sensational. Our particular favourites are baked Ruby fish and mixed seafood fried with garlic. I am pleased to report that the standard of food , service and value for money was equally as good second time around. The menu also has European food , Russian cuisine and the usual wide range of Thai dishes. The ladies working front of house are polite , friendly and very helpful. On this last trip we took my dad with us. He considers himself a bit of a fish expert when it comes to cooking / taste etc and he was equally as impressed as we are.  I can only comment on the restaurant. Dave wrote a review Jun 2019\n",
      "50 Great place to eat We have eaten here the last few nights the food was excellent , the prices for drinks and food is very reasonable and the staff very friendly, we were a family of 6 and had a 2 year old with us who the staff entertained all night. kazwood62 wrote a review Mar 2018\n"

      "40 Good value The hotel is located in a nice area, not too far from Jomtien beach. We booked two apartaments for our families by the pool. The apartaments were very nice, the poll area is absolutely stunning. We spend 4 weeks and we have no regrets regarding the hotel. They have a restaurant which can be quite handy, we ordered lunch neraly everyday and had dinner there sometimes when we were too lazy for going out. Breakfast was OK the first weeks, but after some time you get tired since they do not have that many options, Also it was not included, we pay about 150 bath per person everyday which can make it expensive after some weeks. The staff was very nice with us and our kids, very simple and honest people. June was a part of our cleaning staff and she took also care of our 8 months boy almost the entire period during the afternoon. They really connected and she cried so much when we left. i could not thank her enough for taking good care of him. If you are going there with kids I really reccomend hiring her.

      "10 Sadly, it's time to Avoid this hotel. This is my 3rd visit to villa thongbura but I won't be coming back again. Why? 1. The staff. Lazy, always playing in their phones and can hardly seem bothered to help guests. They struggled to smile or even give guests a simple greeting. 2. The hotel. What was once a beautiful place has been let go to waste. We had one of the more expensive \"Thongbura\" rooms. One night a cleaner left several bin bags in the corridor outside our room and had been opened by some animal. The reception area which once offered a grand welcome now was littered with all kinds of things the staff could easily tidy away. There just seems to be no management of the place at all. There are certainly enough staff, but they simply don't care about anything. Very very disappointing. Chris B wrote a review Jan 2017\n",
      "40 Very nice Very nice place to relax, beautifull pool, with bar, hotel staff is excellent. Distance to Jomtien beach is cca 10 min. by walk. Roos is very clear an silent. I was there in march 2016. Excellent service. Roman S wrote a review Aug 2016\n",
      "40 Very nice family holiday I enjoyed the resort greatly and found the Accommodation was very good and the staff helpful and friendly.  To begin with, we booked the wrong room on the internet, that was my fault and telling the problem to reception, they took us to look at a number of different room options, which we settled with a 2 bedroom suite overlooking the main pool.  After that, on leaving, I realised I left my passport in the in-room safe. I called the resort and they went to great effort to return my passport to my and also check I was the correct person.  The bedding was comfortable and We all got a good night sleep. The room was nice and large and we felt comfortable.  The resort is about a 10 minute very easy walk to the beach so we could sit on the beach in the earlier parts of the day, then return to the pool at the resort.  On the subject of the pool, I had no complaints. Having owned swimming pools most of my life, I know when a pool is off or not. The only \"debris\" I could see in the pool was the flower blossoms, which actually added to the experience. I made a point to feel the walls and the water-line and the walls and it was clean. I think that because the pool is mostly tiled in green, on first view, it doesn't look so great to someone who is used to blue or other colored tiles. If you looked directly at the white tiles, they were very white.  So in summary, we had a great time.  The breakfast wasn't what you would expect from a 5-star resort, but it reflected the room cost. The same restaurant did a very nice evening meal. Khutan wrote a review Aug 2016\n",
      "30 Mostly great with a couple of gripes The staff were lovely and friendly. The room was big, clean and comfortable. We had a room that opened directly onto the pool and it was great. Massive pools and just the right depth for our son to splash around in. Breakfast was decent and plenty of it. Really, really quiet, you'd never know you were in the centre of Pattaya.  The downside. There are two great looking slides into the pool, neither of which were working and the staff had no idea if or when they would be fixed. There is a big gym, currently being refurbished and no idea how long it's going to take. They've shoved a load of gym equipment into a much smaller dark, dank and smelly room across the pool. The pool bar was closed and just stacked up with out of use furniture.  We did go in the off season but it would be nice to have been informed about the pool slides and the gym before we went. Bangkokjacks wrote a review May 2016\n",
      "20 Very disappointing Booked this place online. Looked great on agoda, I used to live in Jomtien so I knew the location and it seemed to fit perfectly. Arrived at the back entrance and couldn't enter as you need a keycard to open the barrier. No security so I had to search online for the hotels number and call them, after explaining I had a booking they let me in. (used the front entrance after this)! Upon check in I could see the service was bad, one of the female staff was quite good, the rest are just lounging around on their mobile phones paying no attention to the guests. Rooms are good and the pool is really nice. Forget about the gym, that is not functioning and the area around the gym is a real mess!    That evening my mother had trouble opening the safety box, I asked reception for help where I was told we would have to wait until the following day for the manager to come with the master key. I said this was impossible as we needed her purse as her money was in there. They said 30 minutes and they can open, we waited at the limited seating area by the pool and enjoyed a drink. The key arrived and panic over!    Next morning we went for the breakfast that was included in the price of the room (50 UK pounds a night). The breakfast was very poor, not a lot of selection, the food that was there was cheap processed meats, dry rice, lazy staff leaving the trays of food virtually empty so we had to ask if there was more!    Last let down was in the pool area, staff hanging around in the lower pool bar area and my mother asked for a drink, they said she has to go to the bar. I asked the guy in Thai and he dragged his backside up and got our drinks, but his attitude was like he couldn't be bothered and we shouldn't have asked!    Overall, the resort is great, the pool area is really nice. The staff are the problem, they need a decent manager to lead them and also they need to be told no mobile phones when on duty!    Will I go back? Well probably not, Jomtien and Pattaya have so many hotels to choose from I will continue to try new places. phiphi2019 wrote a review Mar 2016\n",
      "30 An amazing resort let down by poor maintenance The whole family of seven people stayed for 12 days at this resort in the summer of 2015. We rented a two-floor apartment with three bedrooms. And the hotel looks quite impressive when you first enter it and view the three storey pool with a wonderful rised platform at the end of it and small wooden bridges leading to it. Very cool indeed - and statuttes along the pool with bubble bath bed in it as well as a pool bar.    The apartment was also huge and enough space for all of us. The hotel crew was forthcoming, although they looked a bit dispirited at times but smiles can do wonders :-)    We enjoyed our stayed here, especially playing in the pool - and there are quite a few regulars staying at the hotel so it wasn't too crowded either.    Now, this would've all been wonderful if the owners would've put more into the maintenance of the hotel. The staff did what they could with the limited resources they had - the pool was cleaned everyday, but deterioation had started to show on the buildings, statuettes, garden and the \"gym\" was a joke where nothing did work. And it is a shame, because you can see the grandeour it once displayed.    The staff was friendly and serviceminded - and the kids felt at home and secure within the walls of the hotel. They had a hotel car that took us part of the way to the beach when the kids wanted to. Soulrocker wrote a review Mar 2016\n"

      "20 Disappointed return visit I last stayed here in 2008 and returned in Jan 2016 for one night with my partner. The hotel unfortunately has not been well maintained during this time, items of furniture, gym equipment, rubbish were left in areas where guests could walk through and some items looked like they had been there a long time. The pool which is still well designed did not look like it had been cleaned.    We again stayed in a Throngbura room which had directed access to the pool the only downside is these rooms dont seem to get a lot of sun throughout the day and we spent most of our time up at the main pool. The pool bar is nice with a swimup bar.    However we ate in the hotel for dinner and the food was very disappointing. We had a nice dinner at a local cafe for lunch so would not recommend eating here.    the breakfast was adequate but not the best.    We luckily got a half price deal for the night I would have been even more disappointed if I had paid the full price. Totty26 wrote a review Feb 2016\n",
      "20 Great Pool, Terrible Service, Tacky Let Downs The hotel is an older style, but nice in general. It need of some basic maintenance work.    The pool was very nice, but could be cleaned more often. It has many trees hanging over it, so gathers a lot of leaves and other dust etc. When you look at the sides of the pool, the build up of gunk made it clear that it had not been cleaned in quite some time. The in pool bar was good and the service was fast and friendly.    The reception staff were not very polite and quite rude at times. I had to have my key card either changed or corrected 4 times in 3 nights. They were very disorganized and did not seem to know how to program the card properly. Rather than giving you the breakfast vouchers on check in, they made you come to reception each morning to get them. A minor hassle, but just not necessary.    The WIFI was terrible, if and when it worked, it was slow and kept disconnecting. Also, only 1 connection per room was allowed. I used my phones 3G connection to connect my laptop to the Internet and it was many times faster. The in room internet was pretty much unusable. For a second person to use the Internet in the room they charge you an extortionate rate. You are better just going and getting a 3G Sim card for your phone which is about half the price for a week than their daily rate.    The breakfast was basic, but good enough. Get out of the hotel for any other food as the restaurant food overall was very bland.    The hotel is a little off the beaten path, but that is not a bad thing. But the roads nearby are strewn with smelly garbage, so you don't want to walk down the road. Get a vehicle each time. Even when the hotel provided a free golf cart taxi down the road, the smell as you drove past the garbage was horrible.    If you stay here, I advise to get a high floor looking over the pool. The pool side rooms look good, but you can't lock the doors from the outside and have to lock them from in the room and go around (quite a long distance) if you want to swim. asiatraveler1 wrote a review Aug 2015\n",
      "50 Great place to stay with an amazing swimming pool We have stayed at the Villa Tongbura twice, the first time was Christmas 2014 and then again in May when we stayed for 8 weeks. The staff are very friendly and always ready to help. There is a bar by the pool where you can eat and drink and you are only paying local prices. The room is cleaned every 3 days and they do a thorough job. Tony wrote a review Jul 2015\n",
      "20 Would not recommend The rooms were spacious and had a lovely view of the pool, which was quite beautifully designed. The hotel was also secluded and charming regarding location. The rooms were spacious, a bit worn, but the standard was OK. The bedroom was nice and the bed was comfortable enough, but one of the bedrooms only had a \"glass\" sliding door separating it from the bathroom, which I do not see the point of at all, as it looked somewhat cheap and dirty. The cleaning staff, however, was really friendly and efficient.    I do not recommend spending too much time in the pool, as the water was really uncomfortable to swim in for a long period of time. Some of us even developed some sort of rash from the water.    The staff at the front desk were very inattentive and not very friendly, some of them sitting around watching TV and not offering as much as a smile while we stayed there. They did, however, give us the information we needed if we asked them anything.    The restaurant staff were helpful, but it seemed they were preoccupied talking amongst themselves and studying/ reading a lot of the time. It gave the impression that there were just too many people at work, leaving the restaurant looking unprofessional.    The breakfast buffet was awful, with very little fresh food options. They had some warm \"dinner\" dishes, cereal, bread and ham options, which were all left with no lid on in the heat. I mostly had toast with butter for breakfast during my stay.

      "40 A nice place hidden in plain sight! I was pleasantly surprised to find this serviced apartment not far from my friend's house. The staff were very friendly and attentive. Very popular with Thai people from Bangkok who want to get away from the city and relax. I'd say that the fabulous pool was the high point of this venue. It's cooling, relaxing green tile put you in a very relaxed mindset. I plan to stay here again until my condo is ready. Very convenient to the main roads yet far enough back to be nice and quiet. Hidden behind several private residences. HR Dude wrote a review Jun 2015\n",
      "40 Nice hotel with lovely swimming pool and very friendly staff This was our first time staying at the Villa Thongbura after the year before going only to pay and use the swimming pool, after which we said next year we will stay at Villa Thongbura :-)    The room we stayed in was a double bedroom family room and it went straight out into the swimming pool, which was excellent! Wake up, breakfast, swim, very relaxing.    We ate out every night so can't comment on the main meals but breakfast was very nice and there was a good choice. The staff in the restaurant and around the hotel are super friendly and always said hello - this made for a really nice atmosphere.    I would definitely stay at Villa Thongbura again. Enjoy your stay and book one of the big pool level rooms so you can wake up and be swimming within 5 seconds :-)    Oh just one thing I will mention, WiFi is free but limited to one user at a time in your room. If one person is logged on and another guest in your room logs on after, you will be logged out (hope that makes sense). You may be able to pay for extra login time but it wasn't worth it for us so we didn't bother.    Cheers :-) Matt K wrote a review May 2015\n",

      "40 A great family friendly resort After a disastrous booking at another resort had us leave early. Villa Thongbura offered everything we wanted. A 2 bedroom apartment on the ground floor with the beautiful pool. We took our 3 young kids who loved it. Decent room service menu and the pool bar was great. A short walk from the beach and shopping too.  The only let down was the strength of the pool chemicals, our 3 kids and myself developed a rash from the water, same with the family in the room next door. Perhaps they need a new pool cleaning plan?  Oh and the WIFI ($10 AUD per week) wasn't very reliable.  We'd definitely stay again. Alexander F wrote a review Jul 2014\n",
      "50 Fantastic Hotel - will definitely come again We have stayed for just over a week and loved every minute - I could not fault anything. The food had a great varied menu which was great because we have small children that can be fussy. The staff were really friendly and loved the children also. The 2 bedroom apartment we stayed in was always clean, very spacious and very well maintained. The beds were comfy and the rooms were not noisy. The facilities were amazing. The photos of this hotel do not do it justice. There are 3 pools - one which is very suitable for small children, and this also has 2 slides, a slightly deeper pool and then the deep pool (still only 1.5m deep) There are 2 out door bar areas too and also room service, Wifi is an extra cost but very cheap at £4ish for a week. Location is in a nice quiet area not close to night clubs or bars but it maybe a 10 minute walk to a main street. Beach is around a 10 minute walk also. Sarah M wrote a review Apr 2014\n"

      "40 Fantastc ! We spent about 5 days here in November 2013 . Great value for money and fabulous room on ground floor straight into the pool.    Pros - great value , hugh pool ( a bit cold ), Large room, good tv, excellent wi -fi ( but had to pay about £5 for 1week unlimited ), quiet., ideal for chill out after outside activity., pleasant friendly service.    Cons - dont bother with breakfast ( basic ), poor kitchen utensils,no coffee pot,aircon good ( but leaked )    Highly recomended if you want a quiet place to stay and be able to partially self cater.    Would go back again if ever in Pattaya area. heppyCorbridge wrote a review Dec 2013\n",

      "50 Nice resort hotel around a fantastic pool Villa Thongbura offers large, clean rooms, bathroom with tub and separate shower, LCD TV with satellite channels and a sofa. The ground floor rooms have direct access to the fantastic swimming pool, including a pool bar and water slide for children. Staff are friendly and provide good service. The Restaurant offers good, reasonably priced food and for people arriving with their own car, there is ample parking space.  The only drawback is that the hotel is a bit far from Pattaya city center as well as Jomtien, but with a car that's not a problem. Ingo D wrote a review Oct 2013\n",

      "50 A place of Dreams Our family and some friends of the family stayed at this hotel for one month, and we have been missing it every day since. For some it was the 2nd time staying at the hotel, for others their 1st...but not the last.    The hotel is located a few hundred meters from the beach, but well within walking distance. The surroundings are beautiful and quiet...and a great place to rest after a long day. My family stayed at a 3 bedroom apartment, and we were all very happy with our room.    The 3 level pool is amazing, and includes own pool for children.    And best of all: the great staff that made our stay a month we all will remember forever. Can't wait to get back. 889Media wrote a review May 2011\n",

We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite with a small kitchenette. Surprisingly no in room arrangement for tea/coffee which is a common practice across resorts n hotels. Restaurant menu is limted lacks choice. Breakfast choice was very limited, the lack of choice was made-up by the friendliness of the staff. Ambience of the place is simply great. Narayantravelogue wrote a review Jun 2010\n",

We all loved this Hotel. The staff were all pleasant the rooms spotless and very modern with bath walk in shower etc. Was like our own Oasis of peace after being in busy Pattaya.It has its own excellent Restaurant serving a good selection of Thai and European Dishes all served by friendly staff in beautiful Thai Dress. Is set out of the busy part of Pattaya in Jontiem but 20bart (40p) on the bus takes you strait into town.(Buses run every five minutes.)  To sum up as I say we would go back tomorrow if we could.  PS Internet access from Hotel Lobby was 20bart per hour. John W wrote a review Aug 2009\n",
      "50 Did not want to leave the Villa Thongbura Me and my mother stayed at this hotel at the beginning of June which my brother booked for us. He booked us into a Thongbura room which is a very spacious double bedroom with 4 poster bed. The bathroom facitlities comprise of a bath and very good shower.    The one thing that sets the room apart from anywhere else I have stayed is that you walk out to you balcony and have steps that lead straight into the pool with your own jacuzzi to boot.    The hotel staff were very helpful and always greeted with a smile. This was the perfect hotel to relax in after a long flight and to feel completely away from the hustle and bustle of pattaya.    I would highly recommend this lovely hotel to anyone travelling to the Jomtiem area. Totty26 wrote a review Jul 2008\n"

      "20 Decent budget hotel Beach front Hotel in Jomtien. Good location, good value for money. I also got a free room upgrade to a pool view. But the hotel needs some modernisation. Room was a bit run down, they was a bit of a odd smell when I arrived in the room but to fair it did seem to go away after a bit. I had not a bad nights sleep and overall if you are on a budget not a bad place to stay. Stuart F wrote a review Apr 2022\n",
      "20 Wouldn't stay here again unfortunately The moment we stepped into reception I could tell this wasn't going to be a great stay.    On check in we said hello in Thai and were just welcomed with a blank face not even a smile. She didn't speak to us at all during check in just passed papers for us to sign. We had 4 large bags to carry and no help was even offered.    The hotel room floor was covered in hair, we asked for this to just be swept up because there was that much..to which the cleaner entered the door and swept the floor by the door...so we got some tissues and cleaned it ourselves.    The pool was full of algae and fortunately this was cleaned after our second night but this had clearly not been done for some time. When ordering food at the hotel bar the staff were unhelpful and just stared blankly at me. I then walked to the seabreeze restaurant thinking this would be easier to be met with another man that literally looked at me as if I was an alien when I asked for menu/to order food.    The 'fitness centre' or 'gym' is an actual hygiene and safety hazard. I can't believe they actually let their guests use it. Almost all of the equipment is either broken or breaking..the dumbbells are completely covered in rust to the point our hands were orange when washing them. They need to close it before someone actually gets hurt from the broken equipment.    The whole vibe at this hotel was very unwelcoming. I really just felt like a bother.    The only smiling people were the gardener's and some of the cleaners which was lovely.    Despite all this...the location is very good. You walk out of the hotel, cross the road and there's the beach! The food is pricey round Pattaya (for Thailand) but we found a night market 10 mins away from hotel with soooo many options of Thai and western food and it was probably the highlight of our stay. Amy W wrote a review Dec 2021\n",
      "20 it's a shame the cleanliness leaves something to be desired the showers are not clean no maintenance of the building it becomes a 2 star it's a shame I do not advise it too bad the beach is 2 minutes away it's up to you Mattias S wrote a review Nov 2021\n",
      "30 Close to beach As in any other hotel in Thailand, the hotel doesn't provide more than 1 key to your room. Luckily, it wasn't a problem to always leave the key at reception so someone else from the room can pick it up. Generous breakfast and good room cleaning service. I lacked some strings fro clothes drying at room's balcony. The restaurant outside that belongs to the hotel is ok, but don't expect too much. Janka K wrote a review Feb 2020\n",
      "20 The staff and the location are the only two good things with this hotell The room and the balcony was alright, the cleaning wasn’t really. The worst part was that the AC made plenty of noice but had little/no effect. The Hotel has free internet, but it was bad! Good internet is something every decent Hotel has to provide, Sea Breeze fails miserabla. The breakfast was an other great disappointment, regarding both the selektion as well as the quality. nith64 wrote a review Jan 2020\n",
      "50 Wonderfull time! We had a great time at the Seabreeze Jomtien Pattaya Hotel. Directly on the sandy beach in a beautiful garden with 2 pools. Great massage. A very varied 'fresh' delicious buffet breakfast. The room is well equipped for 'daily cleaning' everywhere cleanliness at the hotel. The staff is very kind 'responsive. We must come back here, we loved it! Pattaya Walking Street' Balihai Pier to Ko Larn island is only by tuk-tuk from the Hotel. Ági H wrote a review Dec 2019\n",
      "20 Not a 4 star property This resort is rated 4 stars but does not have what it takes to deserve this rating. 2 stars at best.  Room size is quite spacious.  House keeping is not consistent with occasions of not replenishing toiletries, replacing only one towel, room cleaning is a hit and miss.  Resort amenities such as gym has couple of old equipments and room safe is actually not in the room but rather in a big room on the ground floor, so it's not very convenient, and you have to pay a deposit to use the safe.  Breakfast is okay. A bit of everything from both western and Asian, but definitely not four star quality.  They do have two swimming pools which is nice but unfortunately the resort staffs collects the pool lounge chair cushion at 5:30 pm where the pools actually closes at 8:00pm. So you have to lay on the hard wooded lounge chair after.  The hotel is also catered to lots of local conferences, hence it is always packed with people especially during breakfast time. Andy H wrote a review Jun 2019\n",
      "10 Wow That’s a very negative wow. I’m seriously struggling to find something good to say. The only things that I can maybe think of are : the room was a good size and the view from the balcony was nice.    Everything else though was just terrible. The bathroom was gross! The bathtub was disgusting, same as the shower head. The room was outdated just like the rest of the hotel. The internet was so slow might as well have been dial-up. No safe in the room. The curtain isn’t properly set up so, because of the position of the bed, you get light in directly over the pillows as soon as the sun comes up!    Usually I find it hard to give negative reviews because the people are nice and helpful. This wasn’t the case here. The staff was constantly unhappy. The only relatively nice person was one lady at check in. Everyone else was just miserable and not helpful. Even the bar staff! The waiter actually argued with my husband over the order and was refusing to give him a cocktail because he assumed it’s for our daughter! She’s 8! The waiter kept insisting its for my daughter so my husband had to actually explain himself to a bartender. When the guy finally understood that out of the 4 drinks ordered one drink was for an adult, the cocktail I was served was exactly the same as my daughters smoothie but they claimed it’s got alcohol. Couldn’t taste it and it was in exactly the same glass and same coloured straw as my 8yo’s. I probably paid double for a mango smoothie because I wanted a cocktail. There was never any smiles or thank you or “anything else you’d like”, you know, the usual service industry behaviour.    Same at breakfast! When we walked in with our tickets( yes, they give you paper tickets!!) it felt like we went back in time to a cheap holiday package hotel sometimes in the ‘90’s. The egg counter lady was hiding behind the counter and she actually said no to us when we asked for an extra fried egg, only one was available. We insisted and she grudgingly made it after a bit of back and forth between her and us with us point to a basket of eggs and asking for a fried one and her saying no and pointing to an already made omelette. It was ridiculous. The breakfast spread was sad, the pancakes were mislabelled as French toast, the coffee tasted very sharp and unpleasant.    At checkout the same unfriendliness and lack of service. I was handed the deposit back, well, handed is not the right word. She put the money on the counter and turned her back. When I asked why it’s less she had to scramble around a bit until remembering that half of my deposit went on the disaster drinks at the pool. In a normal hotel, they’d give you the bill but here no, why would they bother.  Overall it was a very bad stay and we feel like we lost the two days in Pattaya as the stay was that awful. Should have called it a loss on the first day and gone somewhere else. AllyTW wrote a review May 2019\n",
      "10 Stay away At arrival we were checked in to two rooms that were horribly dirty and very warn down. The rest of the Hotel gave the same impression apart from the reception and outside areas. In the rooms we found dirt, smudges, stains, grease EVERYWHERE!!! There was dust on every surface, the window in the hall outside the room had a one centimeter thick layer of dead flies. The bathtub had rust and irremoveable stains. The bedsheets were stained with god knows what????  The manager who showed us one of the rooms pointed out that condoms were free.(!) We were a couple on holiday. We found it very rude. Our friends room was no better. We stayed in the hotelroom for less than 1 hour only to document with pictures and contacted Hotels.com to cancel the reservation, and even then we felt a strong urge to shower just from having been in the room. Worst Hotel we have ever seen!! utpaatur wrote a review Mar 2019\n"

      "10 Worst Restaurant I have ever experienced in Thailand As a long time and honest contributor on Trip Advisor I do nor easily ever give out such negative feed back. However this place warrants it.    We arrived at location at @7:30pm    The decor and ambiance of the place are very pleasant, but your experience will go downhill from there. The serving lady was pleasant enough and did say on arrival there may be some delay in the wait for our food as they were busy. The place was not busy but asked her how long the delay may be, the answer 30 minutes. This seemed acceptable (but in hindsight I think she knew the service standard was terrible and hoped to warn us off).    So with 4 adults, a teenager and one child we gave them the benefit of the doubt.    My friends (a couple) ordered the Baked Clams as an entree, then Fried Rice with Crab meat, Chicken Green Curry, and two beers for drinks.    We ordered a large bowl of steamed rice and several dished including Tom Yum Soup to share among my family of four and a beer and 2 waters.    First failure was the drinks order with only 2 beers arriving, eventually we sorted that out after about ten minutes and finally had 3 beers in total, but at one stage they had brought a total of 4 beers to the table. The beers were not cold but tepid. Not a good start.    Then the food, the first dish arrived fairly quickly for my friend, but it was not the entree of clam as expected, but rather the fried rice dish, then we waited.    A while later the chicken green curry arrived. and then we were left unattend for over 30 minutes. I told my friend to proceed with their food as we had no idea how long it was going to take for everything to come out in dribs and drabs.    Finally our main dishes arrived, but then nothing, no rice or plates arrived to eat the food with. So we waited.    My wife (Thai) flagged the 1st waitress down as some of the serving staff appeared to be Indian or non-thai and did not seem to understand. She told her staff to bring us the rice and the plates. But nothing. So we waited.    We flagged down the 1st waitress yet again and said what is going on? She rushed off to try and get our steamed rice, an easy and popular dish in Thailand. Finally it came and seconds later my friends clam entree finally arrived (after they had finished eating their main meals).    I now decided after remaining silent to raise my concerns to the initial waitress. Telling her that it had taked over 1 hour and a half for all the dishes to arrive in dribs and drabs and now our main dishes were cold due to the difficulty they had in delivery basic rice and that my friends entree had finally turned up right at the end. We were far from happy. I myself refused to even eat any of the lukewarm food we had before us.    The fastest service we received was our bills which we did not even ask for, they were thrust at us, needless to say no tip was given, and both parties were happy to part company never to return.    So it is not with any happiness that I have to award the Sea Breeze Jomtien the award of WORST restaurant I have ever been to in my many years traveling to and as an expat in Thailand.    People, do yourselves a favour and avoid this place like the plague.    It could even put off first time travelers to Thailand from ever coming back at all. Picco01 wrote a review Jan 2019\n"

      "30 Were they low on chicken Disappointed today as I was going to settle in for a few courses. I had a schnitzel here the other day and it was a good portion. Unfortunately my satay chicken was very light on the stick. Satay was flavoursome though.  Staff seemed like they didn’t want to be there. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing but it’s not hard to get this right! harrytrekking wrote a review Nov 2018\n",
      "30 Good bad and the ugly The good  If I hadn't got this booking through a friend at a slightly reduced price I would of been disappointed.  The reception staff were efficient and friendly.  The room though getting older was a fair size and the bathroom worked ok.  The pool area always seemed to be clean and well maintained.Also the pool restaurant staff as a whole seemed OK.  The Bad,  In all of my many years of traveling I think it is the worst room cleaning I have come across.  You could see all of the marks round the furniture from there brushing.  The sink area in the bathroom was not cleaned in the 3 weeks we stayed there.(apart from my partner and myself)  Similarly the bathroom cleanliness was very lacking,(we also cleared sections of that ourselves as well.  The Ugly,  The breakfast experience was not pleasan,this is not solely the hotels fault some of the customers were very lacking in manners.  The food though quite plentiful was not always the best,(quite often very cold.Eggs that were cooked in large batches and left to cool,  In general if you want quantity and not quality you will be happy.

      "30 A beach Hotel on Jomtein We stayed at this hotel during our Thailand trip in September first week. This is a 3 star hotel with all basic services. Rooms are good there are lot option to choose from.    Room are big and Spacious , Washrooms are average, Wardrobe , Fridge and Balcony has a great view .( Superior Rooms )    We also choose breakfast in the package, Breakfast has good spread but The Issue was they started packing up things even before the time Has ended.    They serve Breakfast from 6 AM - 10 AM but They start removing Buffet at 9:45 AM .    If you are Staying you need to handle the Rude Room Service. Al tough Don't expect any room service. I needed an Ice Bucket and I called the Room service at around 8 Pm in evening , I asked for the Price and he said 60 Bahts , I told them to send and The guys from service said ok , We are sending . When I didn't recived it , After 15-20 Minutes , I called them Again , He said I am sendign but it cost 200 Bahts and when I started to ask him why , He disconnected the Call. and When I tried calling them again , they didn't picked up. I had to walk by to Reception on Ground floor and When I asked about room service , they directed me to outside , where they sit , There was no there so I had to come back Empty handed.    After Then , I finally had to go out to Departmental store outside to get a pack of Ice..  If you just need a Stay then this is Good Hotel but Don't expect anything else.

      "40 Excellent Hotel on Jomtien Beach We stayed two nights at this hotel which is located across the street from Jomtien Beach. The Hotel and our room was clean, quiet, well managed, and fairly priced. The lighting inside the room was inadequate. Many excellent restaurants and activies are located within easy walking distance. The breakfast buffet was plentiful and delicious. We had dinner at the restaruant the first night and enjoyed the live music both nights. If we return to Jomtien Beach the Sea Breeze will be high on our list of places to stay.

We have already visited your hotel 7x, because we like everything there and we always enjoy our staying there. Rooms are always clean, your staff is very kind, food is excellent for the reasonable prices. We are looking forward to meeting your hotel in the future again.

      "30 Disappointed Used this hotel regularly from 1997 - 2002 and had a great time staying here. The staff were great, the food was spectacular, and it was very family friendly.  So, being in the area, we decided to come again. First of all the place was much bigger, totally unrecognizable from our memory of it.  Anyway, we decided to stay for a couple of nights. The room, superior with sea view. Good size, but lacking in not having a tea/coffee station, no kettle no teabags, no 3 in one coffee sachets, no milk or cream. Next, the hot water in the bathroom was difficult to regulate, the bathroom looked old, but it isn't, just not well maintained. The room also has no hairdryer and could do with a little more lighting. Step out on to the balcony and directly opposite is a block of condos. Turn 45 degrees then you will see the sea over the top of trees and buildings. The room has a comfortable bed and aircon like an artic storm, be careful where you set the thermostat.  When you exit the lift on your floor the walkway to the rooms is to dark, more light needed here. Exit the lift at reception, the breakfast room is to your left, quite comfortably set out and the buffet breakfast is certainly adequate. Come out the breakfast room past reception and there is quite a large lobby with settees armchairs, tables and chairs for guests use. The next big problem for us was the fact that there was no Wi-Fi, we were told they were awaiting an engineer. Seems, strange, as this problem appears to have been mentioned in reviews back to 2016. Have they been waiting for the engineer since then.  Once you exit the lobby, there is a long walk to the front of the hotel. There is an empty space that we were informed used to be the reception. It is just an empty space. This should be turned into another seating area for people to use.  The restaurant serves good food, in particular we would recommend Pad Krapow Moo, it has to be one of the best we have tasted. So not all doom and gloom.  Some of the staff are very pleasant and some seem a little distant. We can understand this to some extent, as about 98% of the guests are Russian, and there is some problems with communication.  What we found disappointing was that although there seems to be a number of problems to rectify, the room rates are still very high. Not sure we would want to stay here again in the short term, but might consider it if the future reviews paint a better picture.  . rgundry wrote a review Jan 2017\n",
      "20 Poorly managed hotel - never coming back here We booked this hotel over a long weekend recently. We weren't expecting too much since we paid a little over USD100 for two nights.  When we got here it was apparent that the property was old and run down or just not managed well. The pool which was its main sell, was poorly maintained, the water was green. We were first given a room that had mold and the smell was unbearable (a serious health hazard). The bathroom had a chunk of hair on the floor and all over the bathtub - so disgusting. They quickly gave us another room after we complained. The new room was better (mold-free and seemingly fresh), but the bathroom wasn't any better than the previous one. The bathtub was stained, rusty and moldy on the edges, and had a shower curtain that was filthy. No wonder it was dimly lit, so one couldn't see its dilapidated conditions. The water pressure was erratic and often took minutes to come. Our overall experience here was not great, and we couldn't wait to check out.  It is okay for a hotel to be old, but it should be clean. The management really needs to look into this, perhaps even refurbish the bathrooms if possible.  The only things that were good about the hotel were it's friendly staff, and breakfast. But those aren't enough reasons for us to ever return. reenakarim wrote a review Jul 2016\n"

      "10 About as clean as the beaches of Pattaya. First \"Agoda\" room had mold. They stench was unbearable plus it looked like someone had been scalped in the bathroom with a big chunk of hair on the floor. So we asked to change room.    The second room, unlike the first room, had no mold and paint on the walls. However, the toilet was disgusting. Stains everywhere. Hair in the shower. The shower curtain looked like someone had blow their brains out a day before in the bathtub.    As for the facilities. The pool, which is the main feature of the hotel. Was so dirty that we could hardly see the bottom of it.    Summary. We went on a impromptu weekend from Bangkok and we didn't want to stay in Pattaya and we didn't want to spend too much (THB3,000/2 nights). So I realise that we can't expect too much, however, regardless of how run down a hotel is, it can always be clean. Here it was the opposite. The hotel didn't look to old, just very mismanaged.

      "30 Excellent location, good hotel but poor facilities Located in tranquil Jomtien. Safe area for families Booked this place through make my trip. Got 3 rooms reserved for 3 couples and an infant.  The property was eazy to locate. Situated at the main promenade of Jomtien beach connected to the South Pattaya area and away from the screeming crowds of Pattaya , this is located on the laid back place of Jomtien beach.  The property has a big entrance with huge parking space for rental cars or chartered buses.  The check-in was smooth. This property has pool view, sea view and sea front rooms.  I reserved the sea view rooms with very beautiful view of the sea and south Jomtien.  We were offered 8th floor (highest floor), 8005/8006/8026.  Condition of room was average. Was spacious enough but no hot water kettle in the rooms, no tea/coffee kits, no iron, no free wifi (was paid service and expensive).  Cleanliness in room was good but red ants played a havoc.  Housekeeping were up to the mark.  We were offered free breakfast-buffet. Limited choice for buffet breakfast , not much choice for vegetarians even after posting special request for 6 guests.  For hot water guests required to fetch from the main lobby on level 2 (very annoying).  Full marks to location, beach right across the hotel entrance. Peaceful and quiet Jomtien beach.  Local shared taxis very comfortable and plenty available. Costs only 10 to 15 baht from Jomtien to South Pattaya and fro. Available till late night. Very well connected.  The swimming pool was a winner too, though 2 pools in the property one was closed due to maintenance. Happy hours 1700 to 1900 hrs. FREE wifi for pool bar users. Reasonably priced food and beverage.    Apart from Ants in the room and basic facilities issues overall a good stay. Karan Kapoor wrote a review May 2016\n",

      "40 Good location, pool and breakfast, but expensive wifi. We booked Sea Breeze hotel because it's location is quite good. Beach is close and night market is just 5 minutes walk from the hotel. Night market is a lively place which opens every day at 5pm. There is a lot of tasty cheap food available and we ate there each night.  Hotel has a very nice pool, actually two of them, with nice green surrounding and many chairs. The atmosphere at the pool was relaxing and calm.  Our room was a bit dated but quite big and with a nice see view. But it could be cleaned a bit better and the hot water in the shower was impossible to adjust properly.  Wifi fi was not avialable in the room, only in the reception area and it was quite expensive. This is our biggest complaint. I used my Thai sim card instead and had two weeks of full speed internet and phone for just 10 €.  Breakfast was very good, also with a good choice of cooked food. Some reviewers rate the food as below average but it certainly was not like that. Other complain about majority of guests being Russians, but we met some of those Russians and we had a great time together. The hotel staff were certainly not unfriendly. We arrived in hotel 2 days before booking and they let us store our luggage in baggage room while we were on Koh Larn island. PeterG774 wrote a review Feb 2016\n",

Taking shower is quite difficult due to adjust the water temperature, can be also very danger with kids.  Staff at this hotel looks very unhappy.  Breakfast could have more choice.  Outside pool area was nice and clean.    With check out we had some issue, they want to charge some money for missing towls. When we checked the room again, we found the towls.

      "10 Big mistake Since check in we had a bad experience already. We stayed at room 7007. September 22 - 23 2014 we feel unwelcome. And most of the front desk staff need somemore training. They are so unprofessional expect from front desk guy i think his name is john he is good and professional he need to train his staff more.. As a hotelier i know everything about front office i been in the hotel industry for a long time now. Front desk never ever smile . But when a white tourist pass by front staff smile and greet totaly different from us. They have a racism problem i think. Front desk girl doesn't really want to help the guest. They are just sitting in the counter. It is the worst Front office i ever encounter. So unprofessional, and no manner staff. In other review the F&B staffs are all friendly and very professional they have a good product knowledge for our seafood dinner at the breeze seafood nammy is her name. She is so professional and friendly and no matter if her customer is asian or other nationality she take good care of them and she is well educated and well trained. Kudos to Food and beverage staffs. and the management should do something with the front desk only. But other department is okay housekeeping and bell boy is okay. It is the front staff that have a problem. They make the guest feel so unwelcome and uneasy... if ever i am in jomtien again i won't stay here again. But i will still visit the restaurants.

My deluxe room in the back building was spacious, well appointed, quite with nice bathroom. There are two swimming pools with nice surrounding areas. The breakfast was great. '  The lobby/desk is on second floor above parking area in the back not front building. For whatever reason the elevator was disabled from going down to the parking area?    The main draw back I found, is the lack of free Wi-Fi. WiFi is very expensive charged by the hour not the day. TalalZ wrote a review Jun 2014\n",
      "10 Clientele came across as SEX TOURISTS I stayed here for 2 nights with my parents some years ago. My aunt had booked a good deal for us(think 600baht a night). It was like a surprise, not knowing what to expect. Our taxi driver have never heard of the hotel so it took a while to find it.  We had to change our first \"non smoking room\" cause it smelled so awful. It smelled smoke mixed together with unknown things. It must have been used heavily and for smokers. The new room smelled fine. Everything worked. It was not the cleanest though. Bathroom had yellow spots, brown dirt in the corner etc..  Pool was nice, good sized and not crowded. Breakfast was average, to fill your hunger, nothing more. Staff didn't seem to care, not the usual welcoming Thai hospitality. They probably hate working there.    +The beach is just across the street from the hotel. 1-2 min walk.  - Everything else.    Do not recommend it to anyone! You can find a much better hotel.

      "10 DO NOT STAY HERE Ok I never write reviews but thought I had to share.  The room was nice and large. Nice spacious balcony. Dodgy bathroom with hot water on and off at times. Plenty of power cuts to.  Hotel is only catered to Russian tourists. I was the only western European in the place.Thats why the swimming pool is kept ice cold and no hot water in the bathroom.  the buffet breakfast was terrible. not even a continental. it was an improvised Russian breakfast buffet poorly cooked..The staff Can't help you as they can't be bothered.I had to use all Thai Lingo I had to communicate as they only speak Thai or Russian.  There was a bottle of coke missing from the mini bar so I know I'm gonna get stitched for that when I check out.    Avoid Jomtien altogether. Only Russian people here or US and EU dead beats.

      "30 Good & Bad Good : Not too noisy location, Walking distance to beach, Spacious rooms, bright & spacious lobby, Massage is within hotel, Nice view if you get the right stack. The chamber maids are very polite. Massage prices are reasonable.    Bad : No free wifi anywhere (each hour costs USD$1.60 and it's very troublesome having to go to the Reception each time u need one. Worse, the bar pool claimed to have 'free wifi' if you drink there, but when u go, they said \"no more wifi for today'. The next day, they said the same thing again. I wonder if the promo banner was misleading.). Very unfriendly & unhelpful front desk staff, below par house-keeping standard, no in-room safe (the safes are housed in a room located infront of the Reception where guests walk in and out to deposit their stuff and it closes at 10pm !) Utensils are dirty and 'black' stains found. Breakfast so so. At times they forget to refill water & coffee in your room.    Will I stay there again ? No. Wifi accessibility is a big hindrance. So is room cleanliness. Sunnysideup S wrote a review Mar 2013\n",

This resort is just 1 min walk to the beach and offers great view from the sea view rooms.    We booked superior sea view and surprisingly was upgraded to a deluxe sea view which had a much better view of the sea!    Breakfast was great with lots of choices. Service was also good.

We were a bit surprised to see the staff had brought down our luggage when we came to make the change. Worse, they now only had a room for one night and claimed we had only booked for one night. A superior room was available but they refused to upgrade in order to resolve the situation. We left. Conclusion is that they took no responsibilty when they shold have. Blamed their mistake on us.

The hotel is geared up for package tourists(mostly russian or french)during the week,then the Thais for Bangkok arrive at weekends.Breakfast is terrible(buffet style)with little to offer to westerners(cold fried egg and salad).

      "50 Great Hotel Great value for money hotel in a terrific location across from the beach, everything for the tourist is within walking distance ie. shopping, bars, restaurants and water sports. Highly reccommend. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Mar 2009\n",

Sea Breeze hotel has 2 pools. ^^Sea Breeze hotel very close to many good seafood restuarants;very tasty. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Mar 2009\n",
      "20 Little Moscow! Just dont bother with this hotel. Its worth paying another £10 extra to get better. Unless of course you want to learn russian!  They really dont care here and all they are interested is the russians. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Mar 2009\n",
      "30 Sea Breeze Hotel Pattaya The persons who work there were beautiful and helpful. The room were good, and the same was the little balcon, but we would like that there som som furniture at the balcon. The cleaning was not so good, and chance on the bed were not good. The shower was terrible, if other in the hotel used water, the temperature was from icecold to very hot. Otherwise we enjoy the stay. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Feb 2009\n",
      "40 breezy stay hotel location in Jomtien is 15 minutes from action area ie south pattaya.You need to take a tuk tuk to town and change another tuk tuk .Newly opened Central Festival is a must go.Quite inconveneint as tuk tuks wants to charge 200 baht per trip.beach activities like parachuting, ski bikes and relaxing on the beach is just across the road.Hotel is clean, staff friendly and have 2 pools.You can just relax and spend time at the pool all day long.Quite noisy though as lots of tour bus comes in and out.If you stay at the old wing security is less as you can just jump out of the window and straight to the pool on the ground floor.room is clean but not very spacious with balcony.Choose the rooms not facing pool as it can be noisy.Hotel has night live entertainment in front.food is reasonably nice and beer is cheap.If you want real privacy, this hotel is not really for you.This hotel is good for families with young children and young people.They are not fussy,more people can bunk in one room.Breakfast is ordinary. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Feb 2009\n",
      "40 Best price hotel for Pattaya Hotel has good location on the main road in Jontien. hotel staff are good,hotel has a good size swimming pool. food & drinks are resonably price and located close to the pool. We found this hotel to have the best value for money in that hotel category.We would recommand this hotel and will stay again in the future A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Jan 2009\n"

      "10 Terrible hotel Rooms basic, but clean enough. Needs updating as some paint coming off the walls. They only provide 1 x roll of toilet paper per day, so if you run out tonight luck.    Breakfast is terrible, local food, cabbage and noodles for breakfast. Coffee has a greasy film on top. They don’t top up the breakfast dishes very often. Had to ask for the bread to be topped up. Only nice thing they provide is omelette and fried eggs    They seem to heavily cater for Russian guests, as all the signs are in Russian. The reception staff look miserable and don’t seem to understand any English.    The is a maids service phone outside our room that rings all the time, extremely annoying when your trying to sleep in the mornings.    I would not stay here again. Jaime wrote a review Dec 2017\n",
      "50 nice hotel stay 2 nights and really enjoy the facilities provided. i love the pool much. dont take the breakfast due no halal provided. 7 eleven is just near hotel. staff so friendly.i ask to refill my body soap, they came after less 10 minutes. wifi speeding was very good. i enjoyed my stay.

      "30 Suitable for a night or two Location is good - literally over the road from the beach. Na Jomtien is much quieter than nearby Pattaya beach. Hotel rooms are getting rather shabby. Swimming pool is of a good size and kept clean. It was low season so fewer staff on duty making service slow at times. \"Free wifi\" was only in pool/restaurant area. The poor wifi in rooms was not free! Have Chinese tour groups so can be noisy and it's a fight to get the to the buffet breakfast as they all seem to be ravenous! Ian D wrote a review Jun 2015\n",
      "30 Great location but poor service When we booked the Sarita,we already knew which hotel we were going to stay.That`s why we didn`t surprised.The location of the hotel is great,very pretty a small pool(which we didn`t need to use it).There are a lot`s of small family restaurants around,very testy,cheap..As everybody knows Pattaya`s beach is dirty and smelly,but if someone want to get sun-tan,location of the hotel is great,In the twinkling of the eye away from the sea.Breakfast poor,but if you decide to have dinner,not bad and you can enjoy with live dinner music by guitarist H.İsmet Benice wrote a review Feb 2015\n",
      "10 Staff are incompetent, uncaring and rude My first ever really bad view for a hotel! ...I should have read the reviews on here before we booked via agoda, this hotel is terrible they dont have a clue. No wonder none of th guests i saw were smiling. I paid extra for a 'Deluxe SEA VIEW room'. After we were taken up to the room we quickly discovered that we were facing the rear of the hotel with no SEA VIEW at all! I spoke to the bell boy who didn't have a clue and was told to go back down to the lobby desk so we did. I kindly enquired why my sea view room does not have a sea view and they laughed at me. I requested a partial refund for the amount i paid extra for a seaview but they just said 'this room is a deluxe and we dont have a seaview' - so why do you advertise sea view rooms!?? They then told me to cancel via agoda, i think it would have been much easier to settle this there and then? When i asked for wifi password they wanted to charge me for it. So i called agoda customer service instead who then phoned the hotel and then everything was cancelled without charge. However, this is most inconvenient, not only did we arrive early in the morning and had to wake up the person on reception who then gave us a sleepy 'you must come back after noon or pay for an extra night' - we then negotiated to wait until 10am/ After we waited only to find out that they have no sea view room (i would have been okay without a seaview but not if I have paid for it) and then after cancelling we had to alk around for an hour to find a new hotel. All the receipts and booking confirmation emails including the ones they had printed in advance of out arrival had SEA VIEW written on them, why this could not have been spotted earlier and kindly let us, rather than leading us knowingly up to the wrong room. billytom69 wrote a review Dec 2014\n",
      "20 Unimpressed Well, as usual, Ill simplify it for you into pros and cons. I must add that i did not try the spa, although it didnt look too appealing considering there were a lot of (more enticing) options on walking street.    Pros:  - REALLY nice pool, probably the only selling point of this place  - GREAT location, right next to the beach. Only a 20Baht tuktuk ride from Walking street (15 min ride)  - Cheap - We managed to pay approximately 1800Baht for a night including breakfast via agoda.com    Cons:  - Caters towards Russian speakers mostly. I mean, EVERYTHING is written in Russian. Whilst this isnt bad, it is confusing for an English speaking tourist.  - Staff service was poor.  - 1000Baht deposit was required for holding the key.  - Room was a total let down. It was dusty and had paint peeling on the balcony. It really looks like this place needs to be revamped.  - Breakfast is very local - meaning noodles, rice, vegetables, etc. They do have a stand for \"omlettes\" and eggs sunnyside up, but dont expect too much  - Staff were really friendly when we left expecting a tip, which i didn't give because i didnt think it was worth it.  - Pool closes at 9pm...should have been open all night, but their staff were watching football in the lobby area so i just went into the pool and swam at around 11pm anyway! So i guess you can sorta bend the rules!    Conclusion:  The only selling point really is the pool and location to Jomtien beach. Other than that, the service is below par, and honestly i was a bit disappointed with the rooms. I would recommend another hotel for a few hundred baht more. Dominick C wrote a review Jan 2013\n",
      "10 Do not be deceived by the façade of this place. We booked through agoda and really thought it was a good deal. Approx $50 sing dollars per night. All I can say is, I have been deceived by the website. The pictures and reality are really different.    SERVICE:  When we reached, we were asked to give a physical copy of the booking through agoda. We flashed the mail through our smart phones' mail. The receptionist's attitude (female) was horrible! She insisted on the physical copy and asked us at least 4 times for it. I think she did not understand NO or the action of shaking my head. She sighed in front of me (as if I want to cheat the hotel of 4 nights stay of S$200 even though I had proof of my booking). She also was very rude (tone of voice) as she spoke in thai to her colleagues (sort of complaining that we did not print the copy of the booking). In the end, she told her colleague to check from their computer. DUH right? Totally LAME.    ****** Please note that this is the FIRST hotel I've stayed in that wants guests to sign an indemnity form that they will not be responsible for any of your belongings that is lost in the hotel. Which also means that any of the staff can steal your stuff and get away with it. They also will ask for 1,500B of deposit IN CASH ONLY. So prepare yourselves if you were to book this horrific place.************    ROOMS:  My dad works in Thai so I had him to GO DOWN PHYSICALLY to Sarita to ask for a QUEEN size bed as my hubs and I just got married and damn weird if we were sleeping on 2 SINGLE BEDS.We booked SUPERIOR WITH BALCONY (I think we paid more for the balcony). She insisted that WE DID NOT INDICATE a king size bed.WTF seriously. I told her my dad physically came down (my dad was beside me). She SIGHED AGAIN. And in the end she gave us a king size room.When we went into the room, number 412, it was without the balcony. When I called reception, she asked me to go down to level 1. I went and she said \"King no balcony\". I'm like how can it be right???? In the end we settled for a double bed with balcony as the condition of the 2nd room number 321 was in a SLIGHT better condition that the first.    CONDITION OF ROOMS:  Horrible. OLD. Parquet floor was disgustingly dirty. Sheets had holes in them and stains. The wood was torn and tattered (refer to my picture). The toilet has bath tubs but holy cow (see my review on bathrooms later). TV reception was bad. Most of the channels are local thai channels. The balcony was pathetic, don't bother booking. Walls had drawings on it and black marks. Dust all over. WE WORE SLIPPERS IN THE ROOM BECAUSE IT WAS SO DIRTY. The parquet sort of \"pops\" due to water seepage.    TOILETS:  IT WAS HORRIBLE. It comes with a tub but my hub and I cant even stand up straight because the shower fixed and you can only sit down and bathe (or if u are a midget). GOSH. The water flow was hot and cold. Making it impossible to bathe because the \"hot\" is too extreme. You WILL get scalded.    THE LAST STRAW:  We got locked out of our own room TWICE. On the first and 2nd night. On the 2nd night, I was so pissed that I called the person to come up (they kept requesting us to go down to level 1 I do not know why). I asked the bellboy why we kept get locked out.He said the card \"timed out\". I asked \"what do you mean by time out. It has happened twice!\". He just shrugged his shoulders and walked away. Hubs and I told ourselves that WE HAD TO MOVE (even though we paid for 4 nights already).    We booked JOMTHEIN TWELVE just next to it.Though not the best but everything was better. Cleaner rooms, better channels, we could stand while bathing, water flow was consistent. It was basic - that's all we were expecting. Gosh.    My advice- DO NOT be deceived by the façade of this place. It is not worth it.There are much better places in Jomthein to stay in.    Oh yes, I happened to see the room next to me, king with balcony. Even if it was fully booked, the least they could do is to switch when the next person checked out.    HORRIBLE is indeed an understatement. lanetky wrote a review Nov 2012\n"

      "40 Nice place to stay Nice hotel right across the Jomtien beach. I like the cosy pool and the restaurant. Food is nice. Clean atmosphere.  But almost no sea facing or pool facing room. Our room was on the left side of the hotel and that side has residential buildings beside, so bit noisy we felt. The right side was better I guess. The room and bathroom was good. Santanu Bhowmik wrote a review Jul 2012\n",
      "30 OK hotel in good location The hotel looks very nice from outside and in the lobby. However, the room was a bit worn out, some things was broken and stood out from the wall. There was dust everywhere and the rooms smelled from bad air.  The view was non-existent as we stared at the next building 5 meters away.  OK breakfast, nice pool area and kind and service minded staff.  The location makes it all worth the stay, 20m from Jomtien Beach but we will probably stay at another hotel next time. Thom1234 wrote a review Jun 2011\n",
      "20 Avoid avoid avoid I have just returned from a week at the Sarita and it is that bad it was almost funny. On arrival they didn`t have the double room we requested so I had to wait 30 min. The hotel has 2 ends...the `SUNNY` front end and the`DARK`dismal rear end. We were lead to the latter by way of a lift which is housed next to the open smelly kitchen and is in near darkness. This hotel is dwarfed by the large grey wall of the building next door and we were given a room facing it. I could touch it from the balcony and you can see nothing else. I TOOK AN UPGRADE.....FROM SUPERIOR TO DELUXE for an extra £22. However the room was no different but it was in the`sunny end` and accessed by a lift where you COULD read the buttons.  To summarize....it is overpriced, AT £60 A ROOM I DO EXPECT A FREE INTERNET SERVICE, the staff are unfriendly and speak very little english, the breakfast lacks choice, the swimming pool is not how it looks in the brochure and the spa is 2 beds thrown on a small decking level above it. BE CAREFUL as the decking surrounding the pool is BROKEN !!! Oh and the entertainment is awful !!  This only thing going for this hotel is the location. The beach opposite is on a more quite part of this busy road. holmes1143 wrote a review Dec 2010\n"

      "20 unsafe hotel - electricity + pool We staid at this hotel for 4 nights with an extended family, using 4 different kind of rooms so we have enough experience. In 1997 there was the terrible fire at the Royal Jomtien Resort with 91 mortalities. This was mainly caused by neglect or absence of all emergency measures. So you would think that at family orientated Jomtien beach , all basic safety requirements would be OK now? Forget it: We had a power cut on 24-07-10 whereby the emergency light in the corridor did not work. I made the duty manger aware about it and half an hour later a repair man came with a spare light. Plugging it in, sparks came out of the socket, giving the repair man a shock. The repair man put on the light on battery power, manually , without being plugged in. ( so it would not work in case of another black out )  The next day the cable was still not connected and I mentioned it to the general manager. He told me he was aware about it and would look after it. He could hardly hide his annoyance that I remembered him that he risked the lives of his guests just like in 1997. Explanation: public holiday, no repair man. And a power cut would not happen again. No? Yes, next day, again a power cut, and the same light didn't work anymore because the battery was flat. It took them 4 days to replace a simple circuit breaker for a emergency light. Cost: 2 $ ?  A hotel that ignores its national safety regulations ( those lights are installed according Thai law and not because the owners like it ) should be forbidden to lodge guests.  I would not have written this report and nagged about small details if this case would have been solved immediately ( emergency safety lights...)  So now the small details:  The rooms at the front side are absolutely not sound proof despite what that ignorant desk personnel tries you to convince about. Those front rooms have connecting doors to adjectant rooms. The wooden doors are deformed so badly that you can put your hand above the door. So you can hear everything from the room next door. Thank you. All rooms have such deformed doors. So in the morning you are woken up by the noise of people running in the corridors or at 2AM when the guys come back from the bars.  At the alley side , the noise is bearable because the alley is little developed. At the other side there is a condominium under construction, as another review warned already about: noise again. Your window faces a wall 1 meter from your balcony. Nice sea view.  The tiled floors are just dry swept , not mopped. Take a white wet tissue and go over the floor and you know how dirty the floor is in your room.  All walls are just painted and show cracks in the cement everywhere. Has there been an earthquake in Pattaya lately ?  The bathrooms of all our rooms were stained. The walls are not tiled, just quickly painted. The tiles around the bath tub are broken and repaired with a painted filler. Black spots on the bath curtain, white tooth brush stains on the mirrors and around the sink, dust and cobwebs around the room, dusty cupboards , stained drinking glasses.  Breakfast: very basic. Correction of previous review: eggs are fried on the terrace outside. But the guy who prepares them doesn't understand English nor Thai nor Russian. He just points to the eggs he has fried already . No beacon indeed, just factory ham and sausages in hot water . And some hot Thai food for Asian guests and mashed potatoes for the Russian guests.  The pool: very basic but positively, not too much chloride. Unsafe to use: 2 of the children got cuts at their toes by sharp tile edges. Unacceptable. Other issue: several wooden deck beams around the pool are loose and made me trip over 2 times. ( my own fault: I wore flip-flops and no mountain boots ) There were 5 deck chairs ( five) with old plastic cushions and the paint of the small serving tables was blistered. That is where they serve food on. There are no pool side toilets, so swimmers walk in bathing suit past the lobby towards the lobby toilets, making everything wet. Stylish?  Food: of such a poor quality that our children left even the ice cream aside with the simple honest child remark \"not tasty\".  Internet: it was the only hotel of 8 we staid in during 3 weeks that charged for WiFi. 150 baht for 1 hour. 1 of the resorts didn't have WiFi, all others had it for free, giving you the entrance code. All other hotels and resorts were in the price range between 300 baht and 1200 baht.  Parking: across the alley, on a empty plot of land next to an unfinished building ( see previous review) there is a parking space. The guy who lets you park here asks money in his hand, despite the sign shows clearly that it is the parking for the Sarita hotel. Is this Kinshasha or Jomtien Beach?  Television: the 55 cm CRT screens have quite some \"snow\", probably because too many sets are connected to the same splitter. Nice for the Russians that they have some channels in Russian, but nothing in Dutch ( during our stay, there were at least 3 Dutch speaking families )  Mini bar: 60 baht for a Toblerone chocolate bar is a bit over the edge, isn't ?  Weighing balance: another money maker: you can weigh downstairs for 5 baht. No free scale (which other hotels bring to your room to let you weigh your luggage to prevent overweight bags.)  What the high cost for WiFi , the balance and mini bar concerns, it is not a complaint. It is up to the guest to decide about it. But it shows the mentality of this hotel.  Positive: the hotel caters for families so your family members are not confronted with the typical bar girl situations. The children make friends around the pool with other children. The atmosphere is relaxed. The towels and bed sheets are clean. The bath room is well provided with small, medium and large towels, also pool towels, shampoo and soap, ear butts and shower covers. A hair dryer is provided - for free ! The next door spa/massage service is pretty basic but decent and affordable. The tour desk has acceptable prices for trips around Pattaya and is reliable.  Conclusion 1: don't stay at this place because they do not comply to basic safety regulations.  Conclusion 2: this hotel promotes itself to be a luxury hotel ( see website) but it is just a low standard place , which should cost at least 300 baht less . It charges prices of real luxury hotels such as the Dusit and Marriot for expensive food and beverages and squeezes every baht out of your wallet for services which are included at real hotels.  Conclusion 3: the staff did not \"wai\" during check inn or departure. They only said \" your voucher\" without \"please\". So far for Thai hospitality which we met at the other 7 places. regiBruges wrote a review Jul 2010\n",
      "40 Welcoming staff, enough food, clean and properly-equipped. Proper location. Not far from the center of Potaya but much cleaner district and sea.  Good for families and solo travelers. Welcoming and helpfull staff. Be careful with glass bottles of water as in case of they being broken you will be charged 15 Batt.  In general I liked the hotel and would recommend it to my friend. Price -quality correspondence in whole. Helen H wrote a review Jan 2010\n",
      "40 Positive experience I was satisfied to the hotel. Nice location in more quiet part of the Jomtien beach. Beach in the other side of the street and it was easy to take a bath raxi to go anyehere.    The staff was friendly and effective. For ex. I had one day promblem with the safety box. Got help immediately. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Dec 2009\n",
      "50 Great Hotel WE STAYED FOR SEVEN NIGHTS AND WE ARE STAYIING THERE AGAIN. THE STAFF ARE FANTASTIC - FROM MANAGEMENT TO THE CLEANING STAFF. FRIENDLY, HELPFUL AND REALLY CARE ABOUT THEIR GUESTS. THE FOOD IS WONDERFUL, THEY HAVE A GREAT CHEF. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A FOOT MASSAGE AND TRY THEIR BANANA SPLITS. GREAT LOCATION AND WE HAD A BALL. A VERY CARING HOTEL. VERY CLEAN AND A GREAT LAUNDRY SERVICE. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Dec 2009\n",
      "20 Not one to recommend Booked in here at last minute as party of 5 had moved from Koh Chang because of rain.In Thailand for 4 weeks and this was the worst run hotel I have stayed at.Breakfast poor ,no bacon on menu only processed pork sausages and ham that tasted of nothing.

      "30 My week at the Sarita I stayed seven nights at the Sarita with my girlfriend.  The staff is very nice and it really makes up for some of the downsides of this hotel.  Be prepared to see a cockroach or two in the bathroom though...  The location of the hotel is very good if you want to visit Pattaya without staying among the bars etc...

      "40 One week at the Sarita I stayed at the Sarita with my girl friend for seven nights.  The room was okay, but not more.  But the nice staff and the nice breakfast made up for it and left us in good spirits.  The hotels location on Jomtien beach is good if you want to visit Pattaya but not live around the bars etc.  The trip to central Pattaya is only 10 min with a tuk tuk.

      "50 A little Gem We booked this hotel on the internet and stayed in MArch this year. The hotel is quite small and the staff are friendly. The room we had was at the side of the building as we thought a room at the front might be a bit noisey due to the traffic. The room was large, very clean and with a big bathroom ans small balcony. Breakfast was ok, although I am not big on breakfasts. The hotel is ideally placed fof Jomtein beach and there are a good amount of small shops in the area. Baht busses run frequently between Jomtein and central Pattaya and are very cheap around 20thb one way. Previously we have stayed att Nusa Playa further up the beach, compared to Sarita it is vey expensive and not as nice!! I would definately return to this hotel, it is vey good value for money!! Oh and the spa is excellent and very cheap autumng70 wrote a review Aug 2009\n",
      "50 Sarita - a great place to stay in Jomtein Beach We chose to stay at the Sarita Hotel as it was situated very close to friends who live near there. It was a very nice hotel and we enjoyed our stay there - it was in fact better than several others we had stayed at during our 2 week break this time. The rooms were good, with air conditioning that worked really well. We appreciated having a swimming pool in the hotel complex and used it several times. Staff were polite and there was always at least one who spoke good english. Our only complaint was the computers are very old and slow and we couldn't use our own wi-fi.

      "40 Sarita in Jomtien/Pattaya Although the swimming pool is small, the hotel is new. The rooms and the lobby is decorated in thai style. The staff is really trying to do everything to make your stay agreable. In the restaurant there is live music (piano and singing) mainly of a classical pop style. Very relaxing especially to the baby boomers generation. The hotel is really great for relaxation. The sea is just accross the street, but the it is not very clean, just like other beaches around Pattaya. Cheap and fresh food is available from street vendors. In overall, I liked the hotel and would go back again for calmness and devoted service. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Jun 2009\n",
      "30 certainly not good value I initially booked the hotel on the strength of a lone INTERNET review written by a person with a nickname \"dizzy\". I should have known better. I had tried to book with a local Thai based agency... but they had taken the hotel of the list...  On arrival I was shown a small room with a with a window facing an outside wall 50 CM away! I asked for another room and was told I had booked a superior room and that was it ...they would gladly upgrade the room for more additional money than the original price, which was already high by local standards.  After much discussion with surly staff, the manager came up with a slightly better room \"only\" facing the construction site.  Other than that to hotel and the room was clean and quite and the breakfast was standard.  I think I should add the location Jomtien in Pattaya is something you must like .....for me if I want this environment I may as well go to the Black Sea or other Eastern European resorts...  for this is not Thailand....sadly nothing of the charm of the country is left ...if you want Thai go somewhere else in this beautiful country.

      "40 Sarita Hotel - Jomtien on a budget We enjoyed our 5 days at the Sarita, so close to the quiet, clean beach right opposite and only 10 mins bus ride from Walking Street Pattaya. Rooms are clean, maybe a little spartan but I've seen worse for more money so no complaints. If you get a henna tattoo on the beach, make sure you clean off the excess before getting into bed, or they will charge you for new sheets.... A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review May 2009\n",
      "50 love it! Sarita is one of the best resorts I have been to. It is a nice place at a convenient part of Jomtien beach, with a convenience store right beside. For the sea sports enthusiasts, you can also find plenty of activities, such as banana boating, and jet-skiing right outside. There are tents available for rental too, if you are keen on simply relaxing by the beach. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review May 2009\n",

      "40 Sarita Hotel Sarita Hotel is directly across from the beach. The pool area at the front is convenient and well set up.  Rooms are spacious, clean and well equipped.  Breakfast has a good selection of cold and hot dishes.  Large extra towels are provided for use at the beach or pool  Convenience store very close and frequent transport on the street outside.

      "40 worthfor money I think it's good hotel compare with money paid. The date I check in has promotion which agoda has no information and could pay less but I pay normal price. Quite doubt that rate for each day is difference some high some low. I got to pay more but the following day is noral price.  Hotal is close to beach and hotel provide towel and swiming pool which make me happy especially go with kids. Food is good. It would be better to have more breakfast table close to sea side.

      "20 Old wine - old bottles The hotel forms part of the frontage of a HUGE shopping area built before the 'crash of '97'. The area has been neglected since then and is still strewn with discarded building materials, though the hotel and other local businesses are slowly coming to life. Our room (though clean and quiet) was poorly constructed and finished as were other areas in the hotel. Pool close to the road so noisy, not a place to relax. Charging plus-plus for this kind (lack!) of quality is just not on. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Apr 2009\n",

      "40 So so Like they all said \"it's only 4-6 sun bed\" but it has nice swiming pool. The place was great, but not sure it worth the money or not.  Overall is fine, 3 star hotel with nice 5 star staff (except reception in the morning) 4 star decorative and 2 star breakfast.  Love the location, not many people around unlike Pattaya beach.

      "50 Wonderful Sarita We visited Sarita Chalet and Spa last year, and will go back again this summer!  We didn't think that the hotel would look as nice in real life, as it did on the picture on internet - but it was even better. Very friendly staff welcomed us with a cocktail!The room was fresh, cozy, and we could sleep without getting disturbed of noise or lights from the windows (great curtains). The spa is like a dream: great treatments, friendly staff,fresh and clean and it smells wonderful from the aroma oils. I recommend the massage and face treatment specially! It´s only a few meters to the beach. The restaurant and pool area is very beautiful, with waterfall and stone elephants. It´s a real relaxing place to stay at, and we look forward to go there in june again! A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Mar 2009\n",
      "40 Great hotel, Good location, Normal price We have checked-in very fast (they well organized), we enjoyed a lot and really suggest this hotel for anyone that wanted to be stay in Pattaya city for around 10 days. It's also very important that the hotel is located in front of sea and you can enjoyed both swimming pool and also great sea together by 30 meters distant!

Cheap price, and compared with other hotels around is lot better. The breakfast is really good as well. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Feb 2009\n",
      "40 Perfect The hotel was a great decoration in combination of the modern and the traditional Thai styles looks, very beautiful and nice swimming pool right in front of hotel close to beach, located in the middle of Jomtien Beach Road at Pattaya. The room was very nice and clean with large balcony and good beach views. Friendly hotel staff provide excellent service, offered welcome drink while check in Breakfast buffet is perfect with many choices & taste very good. Would love to return in short period of time.

      "40 Best place to stay It took 2 hrs from airport to our hotel. It really far away from the busy place. the hotel is quiet new and it took few min finding our hotel. Staying at the Sarita chalet and Spa, Hotel, Pattaya at Jomiten road has been one of the best vacations I have ever had. Aside from the grand lobby and complete facilities, the pool side room was beautifully designed with the latest amenities, a beautiful bath tub and tastefully selected modern furniture. The spa is very good and friendly staff. Would definitely love to stay here again. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Jan 2009\n",
      "20 dated hotel This hotel has seen its best days. It was very dated and far away from the city center if you wanted to walk there. the beach is just right across the street but it is not a nice beach. I just felt that I wanted to leave the place right away. The staff was nice but couldn't help me print a hotel voucher which is poor. There was an elevator but the hotel was built so one still had to take stares to get to my room. Not very handicap friendly. The rooms was clean but as always in Thailand the beds are very hard. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Jan 2009\n",
      "40 So convenient for me Received a personal special rate from this hotel as a walk-in booking and was allocated a lovely room at the front with great views of the beach and sea. Found this hotel very convenient for me,being close to friends and family, and a choice of either the beach or the pool close to hand. Inexpensive massage facilities were available in the Spa centre or by the pool. I was lucky to have great weather and it was very easy to reach Pattaya south by Baht taxi and walkable to Jomtiem centre. My room was clean and delightfully furnished Thai-style with all amenities to hand, staff were friendly and the restaurant standard was pretty good. The pretty swimming pool was a little small but adequate for a quick cool off and there were a few sun loungers and massage mats. Several shops and mini-markets nearby. The sandy beach was a little narrow but not too crowded, rather too many beach touts but the food sellers offered attractive fruit and seafood morsels. It's worth taking the ferry from Pattaya to the island which are delightful and give a real taste of Thailand and have lovely white sand beaches. I avoided the local water completely and didn't suffer any tummy upsets or see any horrible bugs during my whole trip. Sarita seemed to be a popular venue for French tourists who came and went after just 2 or 3 days. I hope to return to Jomtien next year and would certainly choose Sarita again.

      "40 Unfortunate I liked this guesthouse. They do everything right down to the decor, staff friendliness and even the small rooms are well designed and laid out to maximize comfort. Unfortunately for me, it was in an area that was less than desirable and I found parking tough. I ended up not staying the night as I had an important meeting the next day and I could only imagine the raucous night ahead. Maybe just my imagination and under another circumstance, I would give it a chance. Staff went out of their way to make sure nothing was wrong on their end.

I suppose it is a fault in the doors because I never heard such loud squeaking anywhere and I have been to hundreds of hotels in my life.  In any case at the price and considering the area is quieter than most in Pattaya this is still a good deal. Just ask to be as far as possible from rooms with Chinese guests because they live up to their reputation of being very noisy. Maher T wrote a review Jan 2019\n",

      "50 Highly reccomend to anyone staying in pattaya W1A    A real hidden gem in a brilliant location. Didn't have many reviews so we took a gamble, but all paid off.    The staff were beyond helpful, but also made us feel incredibly comfortable and at home.    The hotel decor is minimalistic with concrete floors and funky bright furniture, it looks bright quirky and vibrant.    There is a shared kitchen in the lobby, you can help yourself to biscuits, hot drinks and noodles all complementary.    The rooms are basic but still go with the theme of the rest of the building and are absolutely IMMACULATE.    We came back to a fresh bed and towels every day, clean bathroom and even sometimes our clothes folded neatly on the bed (that we'd lazy thrown next to our bed in a hurry to get ready.. sorry). The cleaner was also extremely pleasant and smiley.    The hotel is about a 10 minute uber from central Pattaya but also has the beach 5 minute walk in a straight line down the road.    Do not be alarmed when you see the road it is on, there are a few noisy bars but also local shops, salon and laundrette and all of them are so pleasant as you walk by and ask how you are.    We enjoyed our stay so much we extended by 3 nights. Since leaving we've compared other hotels to our room and wished we was back there.    Well done to the staff, you do an amazing job and you should be really proud of what you have achieved. An honest, reliable and welcoming place to stay. Lottie H wrote a review Dec 2017\n",
      "50 Funky chic hotel, friendly staff I stayed here for one night. I liked the rooms. Funky design. Bed was very comfortable. Room was Quiet, good AC. Wifi was good. Everything was very clean. Staff super friendly. Great value! Location 5 or so minutes to the beach. Had free 2 min noodles which was good for a quick snack. There was bikes which I didn't use but could be handy.

      "40 New Hotel, Worth it !! I went to Pattaya for my music festival trip and I have stayed at Achada Beach Hotel for one night.    Achada Beach Pattaya is a new hotel which is close to Jomtien beach and Pattaya floating market.    The location of this hotel has a quiet atmosphere. If you do not have a private vehicle, you can take a taxi from the Pattaya Bus station to there.    The room was nice and very clean. The staffs are friendly and very helpful.  The facilities in the room are well equipped. The room rate is reasonable. I’m worth it and I will definitely stay there again. apimukp wrote a review Mar 2018\n",
      "40 Holiday Hotel in new, room is nice and really clean, bed is comfortable, but location is far from city, breakfast not buffet, The hotel is quiet suitable for relaxation. The staff were charming and welcoming and helpful. MISTERALIS12 wrote a review Mar 2018\n"

      "50 Friendly service, clean rooms and facilities, peaceful location We stayed here over a long weekend and particularly enjoyed the friendliness of all staff members; from the reception team to the breakfast service team.    Clean and new rooms with chic furniture and the quiet neighborhood (which is rare for Jomtien or Pattaya!) where the hotel is situated meant it was a relaxing stay for us.    However, please note that this is not a beach-side property, therefore, you will need some mode of transportation or walk for 15 minutes in order to go enjoy the seaside. Bank A wrote a review Oct 2019\n",
      "50 Best choice for business around Pattaya area I stayed at many hotels in Pattaya and I would confirm this hotel is the best quality at reasonable price. The standard was like 5 stars hotel. Quality bed, clean bathroom, great service, nice pool. As I went on business, what I like the most are strong and fast WiFi, very big safe that can store my laptop and many things. Parking is also available at the hotel. Also nearby good restaurants such as japanese, seafood BBQ, shabu and 7-11.  Unfortunately, I would like to stay durinf Saturday but the hotel had a corporate private event which I can see that this hotel is perfectly good idea for private event because they are cosy, beautifully decorated and have great pool.

      "20 Great Hotel, until we got shipped out to a budget room:-( The Sala Pataya hotel is just about perfect. The staff were great. Hotel and pool were wonderful, so why the two stars? We had made the booking in January for 3 nights in March. However last week, on arrival, but were told that there was a double booking on the third night. This was strange because for 2 days we were the only guests in the entire hotel. We were told that we could stay in another hotel nearby and in compensation the hotel would give us 500 TBT (approx. £12) as compensation of having to move. This seemed acceptable as we were assured that the new hotel was of a similar standard. Then the problems began. We were told that they could move us in the morning but that didn’t happen. We had to move in the afternoon, which caused us to cut short our planned scuba diving course. Then we found out that there was no breakfast in the other hotel. The staff did provide a ‘take away’ but that was minimal, not nearly as good as the breakfast at the Sala Pattaya. The biggest disappointment was the other hotel. Although it had a small pool (which we did not need) it was very much a budget place. Our room was dark. Two very small windows, approx. 30cm x 60 cm, one looking out to a wall 60cm away. The television was unwatchable, very pixelated, sound distorted. Wi-Fi was slow and kept dropping connection. The basin in the shower room had only a cold water supply. Shower was difficult to control, no shower gel/ shampoo. There was no safe deposit box. All in all, this was part of a holiday that we had saved for and looked forward to all year. If we had wanted a budget hotel then we would have booked one. Interestingly, it was impossible to find out the cost of the room and how this compared to the cost of a room at The Sala as there was no information on this hotel on the Internet. Also outside of the ‘hotel’, there was a sign saying “rooms for rent”. Not a usual indication that this is a regular hotel. Advice to other travellers is to be careful when making a booking at this hotel. Should this happen to you then do not pay and walk away – bearing in mind that this is difficult. j0hnchandler124 wrote a review Mar 2019\n",
      "50 The perfect hotel in Pattaya I have been this hotel 3 times already. Finally i decide to come back again because it's perfect!!  The room is nice and clean. The pool is beautiful. Free wifi. Safety place, i can park my motorbike in a night time because there is security man. Hospitality is same like a family.  Welcome to THE SALA Pattaya.

      "40 One of the cleanest places we've stayed at in Thailand. I really liked this place because it was clean and nice, the service was good too. There was no breakfast included but usually the breakfasts aren't very good so I don't consider that a reason to fault them, it was cheap and has safe parking so it was great.

      "10 Bad service Manager (unfriendly old women who always walk around first floor) is poor service. Bad manner, No service mind. Not reasonable price. Another hotel is better.  17xx ฿Per room per night very expensive and not include breakfast. HoneyHawk wrote a review Jan 2018\n",
      "40 Fresh new hotel - good value - beachfront location Stayed for 1 night for an event in Chonburi. We knew that the hotel had only recently opened (which can be a risk), so were not very surprised to see some lobby furniture still unwrapped and the (future?) roadside F&B area not yet open. But the building has \"good bones\", with some sea-facing rooms (with balconies), a passenger lift, a nice & quiet \"courtyard\" swimming pool, and helpful front desk staff.  We were kindly upgraded from a basic Deluxe to a basic Deluxe room with a part-seaview, which was clean and straightforward for a short-stay, with decent new bedding, minibar, very basic local TV, and little else. A small balcony off the room overlooks the side road and the (limited) open \"onsite parking\". The lack of a shower curtain in the bathroom is troublesome, as its difficult to wash without getting the toilet/toilet paper and even the vanity wet, on top of a wet bathroom floor. It should be rectified somehow. The room entry card is a good electronic lock system (you must pay a returnable deposit for the card), but there is no safety box in the room. For a longer stay the lack of basic tea-making items, glasses etc could be an issue, but for a short stay (and with a 24-hour Family Mart opposite), we had no such concerns. We didn't have any breakfast in the hotel (not sure if there was one offered....).  The location is on a busy part of the Jomtien strip, so surroundings are a mixture of other (budget) hotels, restaurants, bars, etc etc. We imagine that the sea view from higher (and higher-grade) rooms to the street front would be pretty good, especially with their large balconies. There was quite a bite of traffic noise from the side street though - it appears to be a popular short-cut for noisy motorbike riders. But for surrounding convenience and direct beach access, we thought the location was good.  As a new hotel, we thought the quality of the room and the location of The Pat was good. There are probably cheaper rooms available in Jomtien, but considering the cleanliness of the hotel & room, coupled with the beach road location, we thought the value for money was reasonable (without being amazing). We wish the management \"Good Luck\" with the new hotel, and we'd consider staying there again for a short/weekend trip to Jomtien. GandCAdventures wrote a review Mar 2017\n",
      "20 New Hotel My friend and I viewed this hotel 1 week before moving in and we were promised that everything would be finish for the time we would be booking in.On arrival the outside bar area had not been finished and opened, the reception furniture still had its plastic covering on, No breakfast facility. No safe deposit boxes. The hotel is a new family run business and clearly have no idea how to run it, it was clean and tidy, with pleasant staff.No issues there, My room 302 was 1200 bht a night was a little expensive maybe 800-1000 b p n.The room had NO safe No hand towels, No kettle or tea/coffee making facility, although one was offered when we were leaving,,No hot water tap in the bathroom sink,,No shower divider, so all the shower water sprayed into/onto the toilet, toilet rolls, floor, making it a very slippy and unsafe area. An addition of a small hand rail, or seat would be very beneficial. Thinking about older people who are unsteady on their feet, as there are no baths.  ( my friend moved to the opposite hotel same price but a little better, swimming pool on roof,tea/kettle, large fridge, bathroom had a small divider.)  When my friend moved I moved into is room for the view, and when I asked about moving back into the cheaper room, I was told \"there were none available, all booked up\" BOLLOCKS, hardly anyone was in, just wanted to keep me there in the more expensive room, and to be honest, there is not much difference for the money.This and other hotels need to think about little extras,, they mean a lot,we all like a cup of tea or coffee in a morning, does not cost a lot. Certainly NOT worth the money. The dearer room was priced at 15-1600 bht and worth 1000-1200. Nigelreynard wrote a review Feb 2017\n"

      "30 Nice staff, comfortable stay, but difficult to reach at night The plus - The place seemed to be well equipped and look like it was renovated a while back, it is not brand new but in a good condition. My pool view room is comfortable and quite clean. It is just a short walk to Jomtien beach and main road with public transportation. Manager /staffs are very nice and super helpful  The minus - The hotel is in a failed commercial complex, resulting in the surrounded building are abandoned and very dark at night. It would not be practical to take the baht bus and walk into the hotel, as extra vigilance might needed. The price of a taxi might offset the good price offered by hotel. So, guests must calculate if the overall expense is practical to you. On a side note, my keycard failed when I come back after 12.00 each day, and their front office are not always staffed late at night, so, make sure you come back to reset the keycard before going to a night party.

      "40 Money well spent Trying to locate the place at night was NOT easy. Even the local did not know it, the name is in English, and the unlighted sign did not help either. The hotel occupies a tiny fraction of a huge complex spanning over several blocks. The NOW hotel is the landmark and Maleewan is on the side road 100m from it.  No issue whatsoever with my room and the lady at the front desk was most helpful. Stayed for 6 nights and the street is dead quiet at night. Fong Lung C wrote a review Jun 2019\n",
      "40 A nice & clean hotel We spent 5 days in this hotel with two children ( 2 and 6 years). The hotel is in a quiet side road off the beach front. Rooms are clean with comfortable beds. There are many local restaurants where you can eat nearby. 7eleven store is on the corner. Local buses stop at the end of the road. We didn’t used swimming pool, it’s small and we didn’t have the time. The breakfast is not includid in price, it was the bad side of this hotel. Charobnica wrote a review Feb 2018\n",
      "10 Not organized, hotel looks great. Arrived and could not find booking, despite booking sheet and price disclosure could not give a price, said had to contact owner. Credit card machine not working and no secure parking as advertised.  Cancelled booking. Hans G wrote a review Sep 2017\n",
      "10 Terrible, must of changed ownership. The hotel is new and the rooms are white and clean however everything is tiny. Rooms are not size described, tiny. Pool is so small and murky that you can't swim, it's more like a fish pool certainly not a swimming pool. Mosquitos buzzing over it. View over pool consists of view of rubbish/building work of building next door which is attached. Noisy due to building work. Reception was hot so were corridors and bathroom full of mosquitos. Pay more and stay in a resort hotel not a boutique hotel. No staff spoke English, couldn't even call me a cab let along explain breakfast so I walked to new hotel up the road as I checked out within an hour of arriving. No English so he couldn't even try and resolve the issues, he just shook his head and said no English, what would of happened in an emergency, no explanation of fire escapes or anything, he couldn't translate. No refund so have complained to hotelier via accomodation provider due to incorrect description. I've been travelling in Thailand for several weeks now and stayed in loads of hotels/guesthouses on my travels and this was the first one where the description and reviews were wrong. I think owners must of changed recently. Shame. Good location near beach. Ten minutes up the beach however better beach and selection of restaurants, very limited by this hotel.

      "30 Quiet street, quiet small hotel First the positives: this place is clean, affordable and run by friendly people. The rooms are spacious. The furniture is pleasant. It is close to the beach, and nearby you can find shops, laundry service, little restaurants that will provide everything the normal leisure-seeking tourist needs.    The minuses are: This place is difficult to find to taxi drivers, even the most experienced cabbie has to enquire with passers-by and search and seek before he is able to locate Anna Residence. The entrance is somewhat anonymous, and there is no sign at the street corner to the small alley where it is situated. The street signboard outside is mysteriously turned vertical.    And then it is not easy to get into the hotel once you have arrived at the doorstep. Anna Residence has a shifty telephone number. You cannot rely on what the sign says nor what is announced on the internet. I found a paper taped to the windowpane in the door stating the number as 089-704-36-78, and the driver was kind enough to call it on his private phone. Then the good lady showed up and let us in.    There is no lift. So you carry your suitcase up the stairs yourself, unless the cabbie will help you.    You are alone in the hotel much of the time. You let yourself in ands out by key. If you need to talk to the owner or caretaker, you may have to wait or seek for a while. You call out 'hello' by the front desk and nobody answers. Not even an echo.    If you want to visit the famous nightlife of Pattaya, this is somewhat far. You are in the 'quiet backyard' of Pattaya and will have to go by song thaew (minibus) for some ten minutes or fifteen before you get to Walking Street. But minibusses are easy to catch on nearby Beach Road. KnowWhereMan wrote a review Jul 2019\n",
      "50 Excellent Service:) I stayed with my family in 301 room and I am impressed with service from Mr Sudhish who take care of every guest personally . Very good WiFi and clean room but as per my observation this hotel is perfect for young people because stairs are slightly high. I will recommend my family and friends.

      "50 good place to stay I stayed 3 days in this hotel .The hotel is in a quiet side road of the beach front. Rooms are clean with comfortable beds. There are many local restaurants where you can eat nearby. 7eleven store is on the corner. Local buses stop at the end of the road. The only drawback of the hotel is NO LIFT. Overall nice Bead is very comfy and amenities perfect. shivani r wrote a review Mar 2018\n",
      "50 A Great Nights Sleep ! After a long days travel, It was nice to be met by Anu, who greeted me by my name and made me feel welcome. The hotel is located on a quite Soi a few hundred yards from a beautiful beach. He showed me to my room which was very nice clean comfortable with a huge balcony.  so after dinner I got the most wonderful surprise, this was the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in! I slept like a baby. I can only speak for myself but one of the worst things for me is after a long day of travel to climb into an awful bed.  It was pure joy, got a great nights sleep, woke refreshed and all set to go exploring. There's lots to see and do in this area. It has all sorts of restaurants so you can choose any sort of food you prefer. Along with all the gift shops you can imagine.  There is also lots of transportation nearby, if you wish to go further afield on the main street, which is just a short distance away.  This hotel is best suited for the 30 to 45 year old traveler(s). It is located near the beach in a good area, I never felt unsafe there.  Anu, Robbin and Alisha all speak English and the made my stay there a pleasure. bnclark213 wrote a review Mar 2018\n",

      "50 “Best stay Ever” This is my best stay in Thailand only coz of Anna Residence..really had a peaceful stay.I must say this is the best hotel I got in my entire trip to Pattaya the room was completely outstanding, hotel located near to beach just 2 minutes walk and you will have everything. Only drawback is the property doesn’t have lift will be difficult to lift luggage to upper floors. But I will still recommend this place to my friends and family and myself also will surely visit there again. Nishray K wrote a review Feb 2018\n",

      "50 LawinTa De Lovely The LawinTa Hotel is simply superb. It sits in an elevated position, adjacent to the busy Rompho Market, in the middle of a quiet side street off the main arterial road, in and out of town. I found it was an easy walk to the beach. I also enjoyed a 'sea glimpse' from my spacious studio room, with its modern and funky decor, another pleasing aspect to my stay here. The magnificent rooftop pool with it's panoramic views of the city and the water, was a major highlight of an all-round positive accommodation experience. I went for many swims (and breakfasts - do try the in-house restaurant) during my short stay. If you are looking for a comfortable, mid-range place to stay in Jomtien (?), then I suggest that you put LawinTa Hotel (see my Coffee Chill TV YouTube Video) on your short list. Coffee Chill wrote a review Mar 2020\n",
      "30 Far from downtown I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights because it was selected by the tour. This hotel was about 10km from downtown that was not so good. Buffet breakfast was also not so much options. Fortunately, the room was clean and quiet. Wilfred P wrote a review Oct 2019\n",
      "50 ONE OF THE BEST The reason why this hotel is so good is because the hotels own description IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU GET. No lies No photo shopped photos and 99.99 per cent of the staff were so polite, kind and helpful it was amazing. Is it a 3 star or 4 star hotel i don't care it offered 5 star treatment. Rooms clean and FULLY equipped with all anybody would need . As i have been visiting the Jomtein area for more than 30 years i have stayed at lots of different hotels but my future home will be Lawinta Hotel on my 3 visits a year. Its a 7 minute walk to the beach which i did everyday . Whatever you need , food shops restaurants etc are all available nearby. Yes they cater for groups of Chinese tourists but this was not a problem or had any effect on how much i enjoyed this Hotel. Thank you Lawinta for being such a lovely place to stay for my 15 days. See you again soon. Neilerosen wrote a review Jul 2019\n",
      "40 Worth the money for short term stay, not long term. Part one -  So far we stayed 1 week and are going to stay 3 weeks more. The hotel is worth the money. Service minded both in reception, restaurant(breakfast) and housekeeping. The room have a good bed size, comfortable, good size room and clean. The hotel is quiet new but already we can see that it needs abit freshing up. That is normal in Thailand I think from experience. French balcony. Pool in 8th floor is good but miss a bar. I guess it’s possible to order from restaurant 1. Floor. Only 5 sun beds. Breakfast is buffet or set menu. You can have set menu in room. We would expect more from the buffet but we are happy to know that we could ask for eggs in different ways, bacon and yoghurt. Hope that will be part of the buffet in future so the guest do not need to ask for it every day. The fitness room is ok but miss more equipment. Like manuals/free weights. There is a outdoor gym just 50 m from the hotel that you can pay extra for(not belonging to the hotel, 700bath for 2 weeks). Last but not least we hope for a room upgrade some time during stay since we decided to stay her for 26 nights. Would be appreciated. We are happy so far and would recommend staying here.    Part two- after 4 weeks.  As a long stay guest I’m sorry to say your hotel still have enough to work on. Your staff is still working hard and do their best to be service minded. That we appreciate! After 4weeks stay we expect abit more from the management of the hotel. It’s normal to do some changes to the breakfast that is offered not to get too bored of the food for long time stay. Also a offer of upgrade of the room would be appreciated and/or at least a offer of late check out last day without charge (we declined the offer of 500bath for extra 4hours), would have cost nothing for the hotel to offer long stay guest. What about a fruit surprise in the room or something to say that we appreciate that we decided to stay longer than what is usual? Anyway we still would recommend short term stay and perhaps we would stay again for a week or so but sorry no longer. By the way, our room were booked with balcony. I recommend you write French balcony as it is not space for a chair. Thanks anyway. Arve wrote a review Mar 2019\n",
      "50 Excellent hotel! We stayed at this new hotel during about 2 weeks and it was great. The staff ia polite, helpful, always smiling and ready to help. Every time you return to the hotel you fell like the dearest friend, not just an ordinary hotel guest.  The location is great, about 10 min by foot to the beach, 1 min to the nearest 7-eleven shop, 3 min to the market, where you can buy fruits, vegetables during the entire day and also eat some tasty food after 6 p.m.  The room is spacious. Since the hotel is new, everything works great. We enjoyed also the view from the room (we wee on 7 floor) to the sea and the main road, from the big window (from floor to ceiling). The air conditioner works good and is also equipped witn antibacterial filter. The cleaning is carried out daily. Beach towels are also provided daily.  The breakfast is delicious. We also visited the restaurant of the hotel for dinner and lunch, it as great. The prices are moderate, the food is delicions ad the service is nice.  The swimming pool is located on the room, it is good for relaxig swimming. There are enough sunbeds, chairs and tables in the swimming pool area.    We recommend the hotel for everybody, looking for relaxing holiday in Pattaya. Maria M wrote a review Dec 2018\n",

      "40 Nice and New Hotel Its pretty good to stay here for a holiday, the room very clean and big, yes it's new hotel, every thing work well and the staff always helpful,    Location : in the Jomtien road just a few min walk to the beach, front of the hotel there is a night market with fresh and cheap food also there is a bar beer in case of you just want to grab some drink.    Overal l : Sure recommended to stay here and i will probably come back agian. Great Location, Nice Room, Good staff. Climber750352 wrote a review Jan 2018\n",
      "50 Value for the money This is a fairly new hotel, and everything was working, clean and in order. A fantastic nice and quite roof pool where we spent many days. The personell was very kind and helpful and did utmost to make our stay as pleasant as possible. Dasko-1 wrote a review Jan 2018\n",
      "30 The Seafood Restaurant I only used the restaurant of this new hotel, called the Seafood restaurant. I live nearby when in Thailand and thought I would pop in. We were the only customers at the time of 4pm. A clean and smart enough place - probably used mainly by it's customers staying at the hotel. The prices are pretty reasonable. I had Spaghetti cabanora and my friend a Thai dish which I cannot recall the name of. We each had a glass of the white house wine (110 Bhts each). The one Thai waiter was very pleasant and very chatty with my Thai friend - I think the waiter was pleased to have someone to converse with - good luck to him.    It is unlikely anyone would just 'drop in' to this place as it is somewhat off the beaten track - basically a stiff 5 minute walk down to the sea and its plethora of eateries. But having said that we enjoyes ourselves.    Total price 577.80 Bhts which included VAT 7%. Although it said on the menu a service charge would be made of 7% that was not the case. We left our own tip. jeremycope1 wrote a review Jan 2018\n",
      "50 Great hotel, friendly staff, great location Stayed here for 5 nights, chosen mainly for its proximity to the beach and the entertainment centres. The hotel is relatively new so is still shiny and everything works. The rate for low season was good and included 2 breakfasts daily. The choice of breakfast was above average and the chef made a point of asking us every morning if he could rustle up something not on the buffet such as noodles, fried rice or omelettes.    Free hint: The hotel has many coaches of Chinese tourists so if you don't want to fight for the buffet wait till later as they all got up and left very early to take todays photographs.    Excellent infinity swimming pool on the roof but with no staffing, towels or a bar we didn't use it much.    It was a very short walk to many, many bars and restaurants, and despite being across from the bar complex at Rompho Market, was quiet at nights. There is also an excellent street food market just around the corner. I would definitely re book this hotel on any return trip to Jomtien. TomOrr wrote a review Sep 2017\n"

      "50 Really nice hotel with swimming pool and great atmosphere. Also beds for backpackers. We did stay for three nights in this hotel. If we did not have scheduled for going to another place already I would have loved to stayed much longer. The room is really good with a really bed, nice bathroom and good airconditioning. The swimming pool is really nice for a taking a dip after a nice day in town. Advise for travelers: take the boat to Koh Larn and rent a motorbike on the island to see the great view and go for a swim. I would really recommend this hotel which has the best value for money you can get and has the really friendly atmosphere that makes you really feel at home. At night it is nice and quiet while if you want you can visit many beautiful places in Pattaya. I love to come back again next year. BTW, it also has a very cheap bed in sleeping room with multiple beds for backpackers. You can cook your own food by using the very well equipped kitchen. Frank G wrote a review Feb 2019\n",
      "50 Unbelievable bargain in low season! I came to do a photo shoot on stray dogs in Jomtien Beach and show how the Thais cope by helping out the dogs who can be shy of people. Anyway, I think I found a second home. The hospitality and lodging can be described as overwhelmingly safe, affordable, and endearing for travelers. I connected with the staff in a genuine way and consider them family from here on. I’m serious, this place is a gem; offering a feeling of home for vacationers that can’t be described in words. I will be back.... yearling372018 wrote a review Sep 2018\n",

      "50 Cleanest I’ve seen for years! Coming into the reception of this little guesthouse, the local lady behind the desk starts speaking norwegian to me! So surprizing!  They have dorms, double- or family- rooms, starting at 300 bath. So it is a budget place.  Breakfast is included, always fresh fruit, tea/coffe in the combined kitchen and sittingroom. There is a nice pool with no chemicals, garden and patio by the entrance.  A big roof terrace, with chairs and tables, and great view even to the sea.  I had a double room with veranda. (700 bath/night). Very comfortable! Good value!  Minibar in the room, safe at reception, exellent wi fi, 3 to 5 minutes walk to the beach, shops, restaurants and other fun!  Baan der Bruyn is in a quiet street, very good for sleeping! And the staff are very helpful, this young lady that spoke norwegian, even carried my heavy suitcase up to the third floor! Even the dogs in the area is very friendly! I hope I will be back one day! Ruth L wrote a review Feb 2018\n",
      "50 A true sample of excellent hospitality! This hotel/hostel (2 options/I tried both) is absolutely SUPERB. Management and staff are EXTREMELY friendly, helpful, full of local knowledge and ALWAYS go the extra mile (I've been helped to retrieve - the very same day/Friday evening/mission impossible - my atm swallowed bank card. Unfortunately Nat West managed to block it and I lost it again. Since I was flying next day and banks are closed during the weekend we had to give up...but not without the fight :))). In fact, the atmosphere is so special that it really felt like home to me.  The facilities are cleaned daily, rooms are spacious and air-conditioned, free wireless internet in the rooms and lounge/also a large screen TV (which was popular most evenings). Additionally, the open plan fully equipped kitchen is an undoubtful bonus.  Beach and night market are really close to the place and not as packed as in more central Pattaya.  All respect to Vilasinee, Pammie, and other staff members, who do a great job here; a true sample of excellent hospitality.  I'll certainly be coming back. _ernestlabaj wrote a review Jan 2018\n",
      "50 Very nice place Nice and peace place with nice host that I never thought before. Inside there was managed neat and tidy.

      "50 Great staff and good location I stayed here with 2 friends in december 2017. Staff is amazing! Friendly, helpful and really funny. We stayed for 3 nights. Beach and market are really close to the hotel. The staff can help you with all kind of activities, day trip to koh lan or a mutiple day trip to koh chang and koh samet. You can ask the staff anything about pattaya, they are reallt helpful. Rooms are really nice amd clean, good bed an bathroom. I would higly recommend this accommodation, great value for money!!

      "50 Weekend trip I went to visit Baan der Bruyn a weekend in July traveling down to Jomtien Beach from Bangkok. Easy to find near 2nd Road and only a short walk to the Beach. It is quitly located and the place is new nice and clean with everything you need. The Manager K Pae make sure you have a cousy stay you actually feel its like a home stay and she can take you for sightseeing as well - near and far! The price is low but the quality good. The room has all facilities you need for a good stay and it is quiet in the neighburhood but easy to get to all sorts of actions. She also has bicycles you can borrow. There is a shared kitchen downstairs and a small garden and a rooftop terrace. Im very satisfied with my stay and will definatly come back. Peter B wrote a review Jul 2017\n",
      "50 Best budget guesthouse that away from the beach only 500m Best guest house that give you a feeling like \"home\" by May, the lady who run this guesthouse with her heart of hospitality. The property is quite close to the beach and 7-11 by walking only 3 minutes away. The size of the room is cozy and clean and moreover, they have a share kitchen area and washing machine for every guests to use it for free. No doubt, this place is the best guesthouse that worth your money in Jomtien.  Ps; May also offer a free pick-up and drop-off for every guest between the guesthouse and Pattaya bus station. How cool is that? Globetrotter_Pammie wrote a review Jul 2017\n"

      "50 Beautiful Place! Beautiful people! :) Located ideally near the beach,this lovely hotel is one of the best hotel we ever stayed! Upon arrival my wife an I ,were warmly welcomed by the owner,a lovely thai lady with a beautiful smile.She showed us the room for our two weeks stay.  The huge room looked absolutely fantastic,spotless and modern,with large windows and a perfect big double bed and comfy mattress.The spacious bathroom was clean with a great look.  Our room was cleaned every day.The towels and bedsheets were regularly changed.I was very happy to found the espresso coffee machine at the reception, to make my early coffee ;)  The owners,the thai lady her husband,an italian guy were absolutely amazing. Friendly, helpful,always ready to help us in anything we wanted.In a few days, we really felt like we coming home each time after our walks in Jomtien and Pattaya.We were invited to spend an evening together by the owners. The night out was superb!We went to a local restaurant with them.The food was very nice. Afterwards we found ourselves at a lovely bar enjoying live band music...We had great fun.And we did it another two times :) Awesome memories!!  I want to say a huge THANK YOU for absolutely everything Nitti&Giordano. Without any doubt Brezzy House become our favourite hotel :)  Last but not least we appreciate everything what you did guys for us to feel like home during our two weeks stay  I whould definitely recommend and I will definitely stay here again!!!  Mille grazie Giordano! Kob-khun krup Nitti! :) Attiatti30 wrote a review Oct 2019\n",
      "40 Huge Apartment near to the Beach.. Good:  The apartment is extremely large with two separate bedrooms. The couple that run the property are extremely friendly and genuine. There is a fridge freezer, TV and microwave plus they supply bottles of water each day.  Bad:  Everything worked fine and we didn’t have any problems. Harlings wrote a review Feb 2019\n",
      "50 Lovely apartment Hosts gave us a lovely warm welcome after our long journey, which was great.    Apartment is a short walk away from the reception building, in an new apartment block with jacuzzi, pool and fitness area within the block.    We were on the 6th floor and views were overlooking an empty piece of land but apartment was spotlessly clean, tastily decorated and perfectly adequate for our needs.    Location is just off the main road, and at the far end which is quiet. No problem to hop on and off taxis which are very cheap wherever you go. Hundreds of restaurants to choose from. weatherhead1 wrote a review Jan 2019\n",
      "50 Lovely cosy and very clean We found this lovely place to stay through others lovely comments on Tripadvisor, and we weren’t disappointed. I originally booked the Breezy Room which I’m sure would have been so lovely, however on finding the Breezy House, although under same owners, it’s about 500yds nearer the sea on the same little Soi. Breezy House rooms are a little more money but a little larger, in fact they were very large, and I have to say also spotless and clean.  On arrival we were met by the owner and his smile and welcome was lovely, as was his lovely wife who we met a little later.  Don’t be put off by the distance to the centre of Jomtien or Pattaya, I definitely would stay in this location (and the same hotel) again, it’s quieter, the beach is lovely here, and there are many 8baht taxi’s 100yds away on beach road.  The room we had (as they all are) are non-smoking and smelt lovely, although if you do smoke, downstairs is a little seating area for you which is also lovely.  I will be returning at some stage to Jomtien and I will be staying here, if they aren’t full.    Thank you to you both for being so welcoming Howard wrote a review Jan 2019\n",
      "50 Great hosts good location This is a small condo with double bed small kitchen including fridge and hot plates and table and balcony. We stayed 8 nights so was ideal as we could buy food and make our own breakfast or walk to one of the many nearby restaurants. It is at the quiet end of Jomtien beach but everything is a 10 or 20 baht tuktuk ride away including the nightlife at Pattaya if that’s what you want. Our hosts were very helpful and friendly they happily either told us how to or organised everything we needed including beach towels and mats. Be aware it is an apartment rather than a hotel so service is every 2 or3 days. We had a great time here and highly recommend it to others. Trevor C wrote a review Nov 2018\n",
      "50 Beautiful apartment with great hosts. The 1 bedroom apt was very clean and beautifully appointed. Everything was just perfect and very functional. The husband and wife hosts were extremely friendly, easy going and very helpful. They offered suggestions of where to go and eat. It is conveniently located 1 block from the beach. I stayed there 5 days and loved each day. Michael Z wrote a review Mar 2018\n",
      "50 Fantastic Place Awesome owners and accommodation.  We were staying in Jomtien and trying various hotels and Airbnb to find a place we liked enough to stay for a couple weeks.  After a recommendation from my parents we booked 2 separate bookings at the Breezy House Jomtien Beach Soi 16.  They have 2 places, one in the breezy house the other in Trio Gems condo close to each other.  Both within a 5 minutes walk to the beach, 711 and restaurants.  Breezy house was great, large area, living room and patio doors to bedroom with everything you need, clean and spacious.  The condo a little smaller but new, clean with cooking facilities, balcony, separate bedroom and living area. Pool was great and jacuzzi.  Niti and her husband and daughter were very friendly, helpful and always willing to help with a smile    We will 100% only stay there in future.  Thanks, Matt and Kate MATTHEW D wrote a review Feb 2018\n",
      "50 great stay fantastic room would highly recommend only stayed 2 nights wish it could have been longer perfect nice and relaxing 1 minute to the beach only 5 mins on the baht bus to the nightlife of jomtien 10 minutes into pattaya nice restaurant just around the corner.  If back in Jomtien will be staying again ma160469 wrote a review Feb 2018\n",
      "50 Friendly atmosphere! If you look cosy and friendly small hotel, The hotel is small, but rooms are huge. They keep everything very clean. Staff is very flexiple and friendly.  If you don´t like big chainhotels, Breezy House is perfect solution for you. Eero T wrote a review Jan 2018\n",
      "50 A Wonderful apartment to while away a month in jomtien beach The owners Gordino and Niti are the most wonderful hosts that you could imagine.    The rooms are large and clean, with a modern furniture . a small cooking area which was more than we required. the shower is also modern and has a fair pressure.    the apartment is set in a quiet soi with friendly restaurants and bars near by.    a one minute walk to the beach.    the owners will arrange any trips that you require, helped us book the pattaya to hua hin ferry and then took us to the ferry 8.30am.    also hire of a scooter is very easy and as a resident you know your getting a safe vehicle.    as a place to stay you not ask anymore for the cost    right on baht bus route 10 baht to walking street pauldriscoll1 wrote a review Jan 2018\n"

      "40 4 adults and a 3 yr old We just stayed here and were really pleased with this hotel. We had transport so it didn’t matter that we wasn’t amongst the madness of main Pattaya. The hotel looks fairly new, everyone was clean, fresh and well looked after. Rooms were nice, clean and spacious. Our Room come with big bed, enough for 2 adults and a 3 year old to sleep comfortably. Wardrobe with safe. Kettle, (no tea or coffee though) 2 free water. Hairdryer. Table and 2 chairs. Balcony with Table and 2 chairs. Walk in shower. Free towels and by the pool also. Tv has several English channels we could watch. Reception happy to accommodate us with a couple of extra pillows.    Pool was nice, clean, good temperature.    Free Breakfast buffet was good. I enjoyed cereal, toast, eggs, fruit, hot tea, water, biscuits, whereas my family also enjoyed the thai options available.    I would definitely come back to this hotel and would definitely recommend.    My suggestion for improvement, some free tea and coffee in the rooms to go with the kettle.

      "40 Amazing panoramic sea view One of the best residence to stay when visiting Pattaya.  I stay at one bedroom suite, room is spacious(1 br + 1 LV room). Bathroom has perfect sea view, separate bathtub and shower. Pantry in living room has big refrigerator, microwave, electric stove, hot pot and kitchenware.  The best thing in this room is the panoramic sea view!! You can enjoy the amazing view all day long by your private balcony. Residence has a big pool and few step to the beach.  Staffs are friendly only not feel like hotel atmosphere but it is ok.  PS. Only this period, residence does not provide food and beverages so you have to arrange by your own. Nararat B wrote a review Jul 2020\n",
      "30 All right Our room was large enough and quite all right. We had a sea view and was satisfied with the hotel, our room, the breakfast and the possibility of strolling along the beach.  Look for more reviews by MulleEllum. MulleEllum wrote a review Jan 2019\n",
      "20 Work in progress This is not hotel but kind of Condo .....  Pool is closed, no Towel on the beach, no pool bar, no water for outside shower !!! Breakfast is friendly but quality is poor.  Room, have to say studio, is big and bed confortable and nice view but no mini bar!  Above all no ambience, no mood....  This is definitely not a 5 stars place 😢😢😢 MissAdeline wrote a review Jan 2019\n",
      "50 A memorable stay My husband and I had such a wonderful time. We stayed for 3 nights in a 2 bedroom cornered apartment. It felt so cozy just like home. It's a beautifully designed room with a spacious space. What we loved most was the view which was overlooking the Marina. Staff were extremely delightful and courteous. Room Service food was delicious with reasonable price. The pool was nice a quite. We enjoyed the walk on the beach to the Marina. It's the best location in Pattaya for us. Definitely, we will visit again. Vachini V wrote a review Dec 2018\n",

      "30 Some improvements to be done the positives:  beautiful room (had a 2 bedroom on 5th floor) & swimming pool, great view  personal always smiling & friendly (but missing some professionalism)    the negatives:  we had some hair from old customers near the toilet for all our 6 days (the room cleaning was very fast, late on day and superficial  the beautiful swimming pool with the stones can be dangerous when touching them  the most disappointing was the breakfast!. We tried it 3 times after 09am, the choice wasn’t big and many things already missing, but the most disgusting were the fly’s on the vegetables which looked not very fresh at this early time on all the 3 days, so we preferred to go to a 7elewen.    good to know:  There is no convenience store in the property or nearby, you should have a car to go shopping or dining outside. There is a coffee machine in the kitchen (N espresso), but no pads provided and nowhere to buy. RenatoCoretto wrote a review Sep 2018\n",
      "50 Parinya To Whom It May Concern,    If you are reading this before making decision; do not hesitate JUST BOOK IT!!!    Thailand is know as land of SMILE, the staffs are super super friendly and really welcome you as their guest!    Imagine you are waking up in the morning; opening the door to the balcony; feeling the air; listening the wave; seeing ended point where sky and ocean meet. White Sand Beach Residents is an Answer.    Enough said! Enjoy your stay!    Greetings,  Parinya kwongkrab wrote a review Aug 2018\n",
      "10 Won’t be a return guest DO NOT ... I REPEAT NOT stay at this property ... the management is unprofessional and the property lacks basic necessities ... there is no ability to change money in-house .... there is no convenience shop to purchase basic staples ... the on property coffee shop is unable to charge to the room ... Internet in the room very hit and miss .. drops out constantly. No toaster No microwave Has coffee machine but no pods supplied and nowhere to purchase ... 2nd morning no hot water in shower. The only good thing I can say is the bed was comfortable and the pillows soft. They have a very long way to go to reach even a basic level of acceptable service. villaanakbali wrote a review Jun 2018\n",
      "40 A Good Hotel with excellent beach view at Jomthien Pattaya White Sand beach Pattaya. Big room with 2 bedroom 2 bathroom and 1 huge living room with kitchen area full facilities of kitchenware.  Long balcony area, with excellent sea view.    Big Bedroom with King size included Bathtub in bathroom, 2 Single Bed in another bedroom.  The room is very comfortable, Huge size with cool Air condition.  Free Still water, Babe wrote a review Apr 2018\n",
      "50 Absolutely great Stayed there with my husband, son and parents in a executive 2 bedroom appartment. It was spacious, clean and convenient. The balconies are decent of size and the view is magnificent. The pool is great! And love that they have a private beach.    The aircon was noisy and the room service took ages to get us 2 pizza's. So there is room to improve there, but that is not stopping me to go back. We already reserved a 1 month stay in April. I will be reviewing again after our stay. NoekeD wrote a review Mar 2018\n"

      "50 Best Value and Comfy and Clean Room is clean and comfortable.  Accommodation is good for your satisfaction.  The swimming pool is brilliant.  Overall is best value for money for business trip.  This hotel is best for family holiday too and they have a huge swimming pool all around the hotel. The kids will love it.

      "10 Terrible Wow this place is the worst. Terrible hard bed. Huge cheap pillows that break your neck when you sleep. Cheap blankets on beds.    Our bathroom door handle fell off when we closed the door on our first night.    Our bathroom light doesn’t work.    We have a pool suite. Sounds nice! Until you realize that this small pool is the same one for the whole hotel of over 150 rooms! Just try to sleep at 10pm when they allow guest to scream and do cannon balls and diving into a tiny pool literally 4 feet from your bed. We called and complained about the noise and we were told “sorry there’s nothing we can do”. They said the asked them to leave but they didn’t. I had to go out in my boxers and tell them all myself. Great customer service!    Well fast forward to day two.    We wanted to upgrade to a room with a softer bed and higher quality pillows. Price displayed on front desk showing a price difference of 480 baht between our current room and the better one. She Insisted on charging me a surcharge for a “walk in rate” totalling nearly 1000 baht!!    More than double of what’s displayed on their own price sheet at the reception desk.    Even the difference in the price of room on my booking website Expedia is only 300 baht! Total ripoff.    This management would rather keep us unhappy and uncomfortable than rent the better room in a completely empty hotel or rip us off. The english speaking lady manager should be fired for taking such terrible care of their supposedly appreciated guests. No wonder why this place is empty!    The hotel restaurant was closed due to low occupancy.    There is another restaurant for the resort side of the property so I’ve gone there twice and it’s been a gong show both times. Only person in there and it took 20 minuets for a beer and next day 25 minuets for a cup of coffee in a completely empty restaurant. Over an hour both times for the food. They brought us the wrong dish and the server and chef had a yelling match in front of us. Absolutely terrible customer service and terribly managed property.    Will never come back and will never will suggest another traveler to stay here.    In the end bad experience and very disappointing!!! Curtis C wrote a review Jan 2018\n",
      "10 Terrible service everywhere. Very uncomfortable beds Service here is horrid, wait 1.5 hours + for food at the restaurant that is dead empty.30 minutes for them to bring you a beer or a coffee? It’s like they take your order then fly in to space every time. They messed up our order on both occasions visiting the restaurant and screamed at each other in front of us.    Beds are super uncomfortable, rock hard, look comfortable in the photos but trust me they are not! Super cheap, huge neck breaking pillows with no other option, cheap plastic, scratchy feeling duvet.    Horrible customer service. Good god. Tried upgrading to a bigger room, the difference online was 350 baut where we booked the room (Expedia). They didn’t want to do the difference of that price which is (kind of) understandable, but not really.    So, they have displayed right in the lobby in front of your face the prices for the rooms, and the room we wanted to upgrade to was displayed clearly at 480 baht more then the room we had. She refused to let us pay the difference of the rate to upgrade to the bigger room and insisted we must pay the made up “walk in rate” of 1000 baht for the bigger room instead. What in the hell? We argued with them for a good 20 minutes about this at the front desk and still no resolution.    The hotel is also dead empty, so empty the restaurant that’s suppose to be open as advertised is closed at 7:00.    On top of all of this, the first night there were 20+ Chinese adult and children (a TON of them!) playing, splashing, cannon balling and yelling DIRECTLY in front of our room from 9pm-10pm (our room has a slim swimming pool literally 1 foot from our sliding glass door, directly in front of it where the bed is, that apparently is public). I understand that pool hours go until 10pm, but if people are being totally unreasonably loud, at any time, but especially in the evening, they should be talked to and be told to be quiet. When we called the front desk they repeatedly told us they would not do anything about it and we had to ourselves, twice.    Oh, and the bathroom light doesn’t work so we’ve been using the bathroom in the dark.    There are many other hotels in Pattaya that are the same or cheaper that are much more comfortable with better beds and service. Highly recommend skipping this place and spending your money elsewhere, or you will likely be very disappointed.    - , From two very experienced travellers...

      "50 Good New Hotel with Excellent Pools The Residence is part of the Seven Seas Condo and Resorts located at Chaiyapruek road.... The hotel itself is new and everything about it was spotless and clean... we took 2 connecting rooms as we were travelling with family.... all rooms has a balcony and ours was a view of the ocean. The breakfast layout was a little scarce as they didn't have a station for eggs. Both days only scrambled egg was an option. I would suggest anyone travelling wirh children to stay here as the pool is really good and kids enjoy. rachneebkk wrote a review Jan 2018\n"

Easy to get around and close to 2 night eating markets,which have the best food selections. The owner is a nice lady. GCCM78 wrote a review Dec 2019\n",
      "40 Surprisingly good This little guesthouse, located on walking distance to whatever you like to do on a holiday trip in Jomtien, is a place I really can recommend.  Up like 50 m from Jomtien Beach road it's quiet even buzy evenings. The room are clean and fresh and even has a small balcony where can sit having breakfast.  Friendly and helpful manager speaks good English.  Ok, there is no elevator, you have to walk the stairs, but what the hack. I can highly recommend Kontiki Guesthouse for a shorter or longer stay in Jomtien. Claes S wrote a review Jan 2019\n"

      "40 Really Good But Not Quite Excellent I booked this hotel using a popular booking website and confirmed the room using my card. When we arrived for our four night stay we were told the room we'd booked was not available for the first night. We were offered an alternative and promised money off the bill. I believed my card would be charged but had to go and get cash to pay for the room on our second day.    At 7am the next morning we moved into the room we'd booked (King Room with Spa Bath - Room Number 1). The room was very nicely decorated and a good size however in my opinion it would have benefited from a television and a small fridge. This room cost £27 more than a room without a spa bath however the bath in the room isn't really what I'd call a spa bath, it's just a large bath. Also the taps don't quite meet the bath tub and the water kinda spills over the side before going into the tub. It took about 25 mins for the bath to be about 20% full.    The hotel itself is beautiful and very nicely decorated. It kinda has like a Moroccan palace type vibe and it was such a nice place to return to after a long day exploring. There's plenty of seating and smoking areas and some nice outside seating. It's also located a very short walk away from Jomtien beach.    There were some slight issues with service mainly due to a language barrier. We were put into one of their hostel rooms on our first night and tried asking whether we'd have the room to ourselves or not. Eventually we figured out we'd have the room to ourselves but they had to get another guest to translate for us.    After this slight hiccup I could not fault the staff. They were all incredibly friendly although I expect somewhat inexperienced. I believe the hostel is a relatively new venture for two sisters and simple stuff like the WiFi password proved difficult to get hold of and there was no Chang Beer in the cafe on the first night.    However, one of the members staff personally went and got some beer in for us which we greatly appreciated. It's hard to fault their efforts and with just a bit more time to iron out the wrinkles this place would get a five star review from me.    I look forward to staying here again in the future.

      "10 Unfriendly We booked by expedia, received a confirmation and had already paid. When we arrived at 7 pm with our 2 children she told us that she does not have a room. Obviously she was overbooked. She was very unfriendly and did not accept that she should help us. Instead of helping us they insulted us. familienreisender wrote a review Jan 2019\n",

      "10 this place is more like a hostel than a hotel not a very nice place too stay,loud,bathrooms are disgusting more like a hostel for young kids,disgusting showers had too keep on asking for extra toilet paper also no good for food thats of cause if u want too wait for a couple of hippies too make it for u,don,t advise too go in the pool if u want too call it a pool stinking mun,only 2 sun loungers lol but be quick if u want too lay there i would,nt advise too take your partners here that,s for sure not a very happy place its sad and depressing ,mmm staff was ok not too sure if they were local or staff some of them,make sure if anyone wants too stay here get the back room entirely up to u but be advised not too oh another thing watch the cockroaches don,t get u first samanddean01 wrote a review Feb 2019\n",
      "40 Nice rooms It took a bit to find among the rows of bars and hotels as there was no sign though Google map pointed it out. Very very nice spacious room with a comfortable bed and pillows. Almost seemed like a 3-4 star hotel room. I really really liked it. Only downside is there is no elevator and wifi was very weak when we were there. TREKKEARL wrote a review Oct 2018\n",
      "10 Don't go there -There was no water in the toilet  -There was mould in the mattress; disgusting  -We left quickly and quietly. I was travelling with my ten-years-old daughter and I could never stay overnight there with her (or anyone)  -Just look at the photos, you'll understand Ailamari V wrote a review May 2017\n",
      "50 Enjoyable Trip to Pattaya It's the second time, me and my girlfriend are visiting this hotel.  First of all, when we came here, we didn't expected too much, but this place convinced us.  The pool is nice, the location is amazing.  Actually you just have to walk 1min to the beautiful jomtien beach.    The host is more than friendly, the accommodation is reaching our expectations fully.    To sum it all up, it's a nice place to stay at your vacation days at pattaya.    You won't regret it.

      "10 A nightmare We took a cab from our final stop in Thailand after visiting Krabi and Bangkok and were truly disappointed by Boutique Jomtien and the surrounding. The hotel was difficult to find and was secluded in a shady street. When we reached the Hotel the receptionist actually lifted no bags and we were with 4 in the end he lifts the lightest one and tells us the heaviest one is for you. Once we arrived to our room they it was smelling of cigarette smell all over the place. The ac was leaking and the shower and the washroom is an absolute mess. No drainage system in the bathroom made the place flooded and filled with nasty germs in the washroom. We were cheated with the wifi as well as we were placed on the 2nd floor with no wifi connection and the person in charge lied saying that the connection went out today morning and we have called someone we stayed there for 3 nights and mind you no one showed up. We had itinerary planned for our next day in PATTAYA and could not come through cuz the only wifi available was near the receptionist. The English TV channels and the pool are the two things which save the place. Overall a terrible experience and we were waiting for our 3 nights to end and leave this horrid place.

      "10 Horrid stay The hotel and rooms were terrible . Dirty bathroom and nasty ac that was leaking the whole time . Room freezes and the thermostat does not work . . The shower room is disgusting and floods . Horrible experience! Only saving grace is the pool .staff are unhelpful no room service ! Nichelle A wrote a review Jul 2015\n",
      "50 You get more then what you pay... Selecting this property for my pattaya stay was not wrong decision. I have booked this room @ only 500 bhat Per day, but the room was very specious, bathroom were clean and the most I liked The swimming pool, location of property is just in walking distance from Jomtien Beach and all basic needings shop and restaurant are nearby.    Property is Managed by two guys both are very hard working and friendly. They help me lot with travelling information.    If you are on budget trip this is the best property for stay.    I enjoyed my stay there I didn't expect too much because I spend only 500 bhat.    Best of luck team boutique Jomtien.    See you soon.... Re Raisining Of... T wrote a review Jul 2015\n"

      "30 Ok if you don't expect too much When we arrived there was a lovely woman who greated us and let us straight in, we were given a safe and a fridge full of cold water, the staff were very pleasant.  We had the 5 bedroom villa with a pool and Jacuzzi, this villa would have been worth twice as much as we paid if they kept up with the maintenance, if I was a family if 5 and paid all the money we did £395 for 2 nights I would have been disappointed but as this was split by 6 people we didn't complain, the bathrooms were scummy and dirty, but the kitchen was just disgusting it smelled like rotting fish we aired it out but the smell just didn't leave, we didn't use the kitchen for this reason, the pool despratly needs 're grouting as it hasn't got any left and I did graze myslef! The jaquzi is very unpleasant to sit in, I'm not sure if they have changed the water or used enough chlorine in the pool as all our swimming stuff turned orange? If you're travelling like we were I would say go for it as it's a huge house for very cheap! Maybe not great for a family Jones9890 wrote a review Feb 2019\n"

If we comeback to Pattaya for holiday I will stay there again Huy Nguyen wrote a review Jan 2019\n",
      "50 This could be paradise... I was looking for a quiet place to rest during my last days in Thailand. Regarding the pictures and reviews I booked this new hostel : it was definitely the right choice.  I had a double room with balcony and shared bathroom on the same level (man and ladies separated, and enough showers and toilets, no need to wait). And so clean !!  This place is so nice for groups, families or solo travelers.  It is just 2 walking minutes from the beach, market, shops, restaurants and even transport to Pattaya city.  You can lay or sit down in the garden and listen to relax music.  Staff is so friendly and helpful and during the night there are guardians so you feel secure.    Would definitely stay here again!!  Thank you 🙏 Veni Vidi wrote a review Dec 2018\n",
      "50 Alot of advantage in here Good position for beach, friendly staff, clean house, warm home...  BBQ outside with seafood. The music is very soft and romance.  My family is relax and comfortable. The price is resonable.  Everything is very good. NguyenSonTung wrote a review Oct 2018\n",

      "50 Likely place Very good place with best facilities.  The manager and staff are very kind.  Very clean  The best place near the beach  I had best time there and i suggest this place .  Foods and drinks fantastic  All thing is ok 👍👍👍 Saeed P wrote a review Jul 2018\n",
      "50 Cute hotel & excellent service The hotel is very unquie compared to others nearby. Only 9 rooms with 1 very small restaurant, 1 kitchen with complimentary drinking water. We had 2 pleasure days staying here.    The hotel is really near many attractions like Jomtien beach, Jomtien night market, massgae and restaurant. You also can easily catch a song theo taxi from Jomtien road. Hotel also can help you book tour to Coral/ Koh Larn island.    The boss & staffs are really helful & friendly. The atmosphere is so peaceful and quite.I am so happy during the time I & my friend were there. We will come back here when we travel Pattaya again. KCuong Bui wrote a review Apr 2018\n"

We left & booked a room in hotel downtown. When Expedia contacted Atlantis Jomtien Condo they denied offering us a refund. We lost our fees paid for those 9 days . Just recently we read that the operator of Atlantis Jomtien Condo was arrested in a sting for operating without a license as a Hotel which they can not awuire as a Condo. Good for them . This is good work by the Pattaya Police protecting us foreign tourist. Thank you Pattaya Police ! edh31082 wrote a review Jun 2019\n",
      "10 To avoid driving in themadness of songkran We booked 2 rooms for 2 nights. We arrived, the keys for 1 room were in the post box. The entrance to B building was awful, felt like I was in an old neglected council block. We get to the room in the 4th floor, it was awful. The furniture is done, the bed was brick hard. 3 pillows, yes the bedding was clean but it was full of cigarette holes, the walls were badly marked. All in all it was hideous. We didn't bother requesting the keys for the 2nd room as we knew our friends wouldn't either.  Unfortunately I didn't take photos and on complaining we were asked to drive back (in amongst the mayhem of songkran revellers) to discuss what we weren't happy about. We weren't willing to do so, therefore put it down to a bad loss.  Never would I recommend this place. kazymac49 wrote a review Apr 2019\n"

There is even an elevator, which is very convenient as there are 5 floors in total. Finally both staff and owner will make you feel welcomed. Definitely recommend this place!

WiFi, cable tv, hot water, cotton sheets bed, balcony, scooters for rent (with local or international license) The boss is super cool and speaks several languages fluently (English, French, Spanish, Indonesian, Arabic}.

      "50 Great first dormatory experience I really enjoyed staying here, peaceful place, close to everything.. Great helpful staff and as for my first time in dorm I slept very well. Bed is big and confortable. Privacy is OK with light occulting curtains, you have a private lamp and plug for your phone. Wifi is excellent. I enjoyed using the common kitchen to prepare my own meal. Homemade great lemon juice for 20 bath and free mineral water . Comfortable lobby where you can relax read (lots of guides..) or work on computer. I recommend, will come back for sure.

      "40 A nice place to stay close to the see Nice clean rooms with a shower, toilet and a shell. Comfortable beds with curtains. One night a prostitute was sitting near the lobby and offered me to spend a night with her. Obviously, she works together with the staff and pays the hostel to be able to advertise her services there.    The receptionist man was gloomy-looking with so tired and upset face. He wasn’t really eager to help answering my how-to-get-to questions. It seemed like someone woke him up, kicked him below his back and forced him to work for food.    The hostel is about 2 minutes walk to the see - that’s a really good point. The place is surrounded by miscellaneous shops and cafes with good food. Danil wrote a review Nov 2018\n",
      "10 Awoke to thief in room I had an awful stay at this property. While I’m having difficulty placing the responsibility of management in all of this, I decided that my experience alone warrants a negative review because of safety concerns in the area and on the property.    I was staying on the 3rd floor and the patio was facing the back of the property, an area with trees. After staying for two weeks, I had a really bad night. I awoke in the middle of the night and heard a plastic bag rustle and thought maybe an animal was in my room. I picked up my phone and shined the light towards the bags. I then heard footsteps coming towards my bed and saw a shadow. I yelled out and the person ran out my patio window and must have climbed down some rails in the back. This shook me up as I could have been hurt. They were able to fish all of the cash out of my wallet (about $150 US) but did not take my cards or electronics (likely because they ran out of time).    Management does not speak English and did nothing except shrug and stare at video cameras that do not capture the back of the property (only inside). Not sure if I was targeted since I was the only Westerner around and I‘m curious to know how the thief knew which room to hit. If you go, make sure to lock your sliding door as someone will likely end up at your patio in the middle of the night.    I accept my partial responsibility due to forgetting to latch my patio door, but it is unnerving to know that if you stay in this property, people are scoping you out and people are walking around patios and checking doors while you are in bed.    They need better security around the back of the property. I could not understand the front desk staff but he seemed to be pointing to a disconnected camera like maybe it was supposed to capture the back of the property? Whatever the case, it was not functioning.    Aside from the thief, the room was decent value but staff was not very available and often away from the front desk. Checking out early, I could not even negotiate for a refund due to language issues. Since I paid upfront, I lost a lot of money.    This was an awful experience. Not only do I not recommend this place, but recommend staying in an area of town that is safer. I saw one solo female traveler checking in before this event occurred. I don’t recommend solo female travelers stay here. Kosmosis707 wrote a review May 2018\n",
      "50 Best value for the money, good homemade lemon aid! Excellent facility overall. Great management team! Free drinking water, excellent balcony views and you can see the sea from the upper floor balconies on one side and garden views from the other side of the building.

The hostel is at the end of a quiet street about 1 minute to Jomtien Beach with it's long waterfront, great for strolling. Close to lots of food places, very convenient - not in the middle of the busier/crazier parts of Pattaya - which I liked. my room was clean, beds were comfy, and it was very quiet at night for sleeping. The bathroom was huge and clean. I could not ask for more. The staffs were friendly and helpful. Very excellent experience. Thanks Joe and staffs. We would definitely stay here again.

The balcony allowed my to dry my stuff after diving and the Italian shower had nice hot water which was great.  I also had a fridge in the room and could cook in the downstairs kitchen.

You have a curtain and and place to plug in your phone. 2 sets of lockers which is awesome: one under the bed & a smaller one against the wall. They will provide you with one lock and key. One toilet & shower/sink in each dorm room. They give you a large towel as a blanket which I really didn't like, wasn't comfortable or warm. The air con. works great so just bundle up! There's a microwave in the hallway on the second floor. The staff is friendly! Talk to John or Paul if you need directions, recommendations, or anything! the location is right near the beach. But far from walking street, about 25 mins by taxi. But there's a jomtien market & plenty of shops/massage/resturants in jomtien . mandy4press wrote a review Dec 2016\n",

Laundry services are provided. During the stay, guests have an access to share kitchen and lounge. The hostel is quiet right in off the main road of Jomtien Beach, but is still consider a short distance walking out to the beach and main street shops, restaurants and 7/11 etc. Doors away will can find some local eatery and convenient store. Easily to get a 10 Baht for short destination.on a Songtaew to Pattaya Beach. Room is big with working air con and a big fridge, the only thing is the water pressure is low. Nice friendly staff.

      "40 Nice stay We ended up in Pattaya as a last minute trip. My husband and I were at a loose end during our travels for a few days and so was our friend who was travelling elsewhere. Both of us needed to be in Bangkok but wanted some r&r time and Pattaya was the closest beach.    I wouldn't recommend this location at all! It's like the Benidorm of English holidays.    If you have to put yourself in this place however, we would recommended Jomtien Hostel. Rooms were large, beds were clean and it was close enough to amenities and transport.    Only criticism is that the lady who checked us in,l was very slow! We had been travelling for about 11 hours, which she knew of, but didn't take this into consideration and was flapping about. She didn't tell us that if we needed our room cleaned we would have to put a sign on our door asking for this to be done. Because of this, we didn't have our room cleaned for four days and every time we went down to complain, there was nobody at reception.    The owner who we met on the last day was very cheerful and helpful. Was just a shame he hadn't been around for the duration of our stay. Would recommend this accommodation anyway - can get laundry done here! MrsCGMarshall wrote a review May 2016\n",

      "50 Very pleasing stay, friendly people We six friends from India traveled to Pattaya Last December and stayed in this hostel.  Apart from overall good service experience, one special mention i would like to make here is about its owner John. In my case, I recently had acquired International driving License and was desperate for a road trip from Pattaya to Bangkok . I was talking to various tour operators for a rental car on a reasonable price to fulfill my long cherished dream. John was working on his laptop there in the lobby and instantly joined me in this pursuit .  evening passed in the exercise and nothing seemed working as charges were exorbitant(Two way Charge + this, that ...) . Finally, John Offered me his own car to fulfill my wish. We drove together from Pattaya to Bangkok next morning . On the way we had coffee and very insightful discussions on life, career, business, money and relationships.  This one help from John made this trip worth memorable for lifetime.

      "50 SUPER ECO FRIENDLY HOTEL i have never stayed at a hostel before ever. i read the reviews and i decided to try it. (thanks trip advisor!!) my initial impression when i walked in is how pristine and clean it was ( i walked barefoot in the room and floor was squeaky clean). my room was super comfy, like an apartment home, not a hotel. standard room is very spacious. has fridge, dining table and four chairs, large bathroom. has private balcony with a sink and drying line- perfect after a day at the beach to rinse out your bathing suit and hang dry. the drapes in room has some sort of silver lining behind- it blocks out the sun and keeps room cool and dark. there is a combination of fan and air conditioning, which keeps the room nice and cool. the hotel is very quiet and has a full clean kitchen downstairs if you need. there are recycling bins near the elevators for plastics and paper, which is wonderful. they also rent mopeds for 200 baht daily. we are going to rent one tomorrow to take a drive down the coast. super happy with the staff. they are very kind and you can tell very honest. if you want luxury, this is not the place for you. but if you want a comfortable apartment style home for a stay- this is definitely the place! mina466 wrote a review Mar 2016\n",
      "50 Simply ideal place to stay A simple hostel in a simple place, in a nice way. Lovely, friendly and honest staff. Reimbursed me without me noticing a very slight overcharge. Co-owner was a very friendly chap too, chatted for a while in the lobby, the sort of person that can be learned from. Room was everything we needed it to be. Comfy bed. Good shower. Nice sized room and good wifi (sometimes not so good in the room but I think it was reset at one point and worked just fine.)    My girlfriend and I visited just for one night to spend a day on the beach before heading to northern Thailand. If you're a couple like us and haven't heard much about Pattaya then just trust me, stick to quiet Jomtien. Each to their own, but it is most definitely not the place for us. More suited to the countless middle aged western and Russian men. georgeyboy714 wrote a review Jan 2016\n",

Hostel owner Mr. Jon is a great person, very smart and talent enough. I stayed here for 10 nights and it was very good price for the quality received. Very friendly staff, clean, nice common areas but dorm’s washroom is tiny. I noticed that always Mr. Jon tried to cooperate his guest just because he is very helpful person. Once I saw that he went to the hospital with his guest. Anyway, I guess if I ever been in Pattaya again, off course I will stay in Jomtien hostel.

There are curtains for privacy. The air condition works well. The wifi is good. The shower is warm and there is enough water. It is close to the ocean. I definitely come back!

      "40 Very Good! This hostel was very clean and welcoming. The showers were hot with good water pressure, and the rooms were nicely air-conditioned. The hostel is down a side road from the beach, but I felt very safe walking to and from both day and night. The Sarita is the hotel on the corner of the street this hostel is on and the main street. I would recommend that one gives that hotel name to taxi and songtao drivers because it is much better known and easier to find. The beach is very near by, although the hostel does not appear to have a beach view. All the staff were friendly and smiling, often playing western music for us when we were sitting in the clean and comfortable common areas. I would recommend this hostel to my friends for sure!

Perfect location for people who want to stay on budget in Jomtien. Stayed in mixed dorm, the bathroom needs attention & air conditioning can be improved as it takes about 30 minutes for the unit to make room comfortable. Enjoyed the breakfast as well.

You can also rent a bike at the hostel and renting a bike I think is the best way to get around places in the city.

There was also a fridge and tv in the room. The fridge was great for freezing water. The ecology place around the corner was great for meals. There was also a washing machine next door. The hostel is about 5km from central Pattaya but there are sorngtaews for 10bht running every couple of minutes. There are also mas available and plenty of shops within walking distances nearby.

They guided us how to travel in Pattaya and also informed us what places we can visit. Room was very clean and big. Bed was very comfortable and their breakfast was very simple and delicious. Good location and very close to the beach. With the tariff they offer, this hostel is definitely worth a visit.    I am looking forward for a revisit to this place.

Located a very short walk from the beach, this very clean hostel/hotel has an excellent and professional staff. The manager, John, is a man of high caliber and very willing to help when he is able. I ended a 3 month tour of Thailand at this location and can say without reservation that the value for your money is high. Be sure to ask about Ecology Diner, located nearby it was the best food I had eating during my trip and very affordable. Jacob H wrote a review May 2015\n",

If I had the opportunity to stay at Buckingham palace for the week or the Jomtein beach hostel then I would gladly tell the queen of England to go f£$k herself. The only bad thing I have to say is the flies living in the street. Very relaxed atmosphere, good air conditioning, wifi is bang on, extremely clean, the staff bend over backwards to help you and John the owner is a very funny guy with a strange accent that makes me laugh.

Quiet Aircon mitsubishi or fan with nice hot shower.Fiber Wifi very fast and staff very helpful and sympathic.  Also an excellent point you can have home made bread and jam for your breakfast.  Ask john he will make sure that you spend a really good time in Jomtien hostel and don't hesitate to ask him anything.  I read some negative comments and this doesn't reflect what i saw here. Most features are well maintain and anything wrong notified to the front desk will be attended to.  So if you rate a budget hostel as the Hilton dont bother just go to the Hilton...  Jomtien hostel in my experience was amazing and fun  i will be back for sure. Thierry_inholidays wrote a review Apr 2015\n"

      "20 Rude and bug-filled room I arrived to this hostel during a rain storm, completely soaked and completely overwhelmed by the fact that it was difficult to find from the main Pattaya bus station. My luggage and clothing were soaked and I was shivering and the \"boyfriend of the owner\" was cocky and rude when I asked to have 8 articles of clothing dried since I had nothing else. His smart response was \"the sun is a better more energy efficient way to dry clothing.\" With the thunder and lighting pounding and my pleas to have something dried, I felt disrespected and offended by this comment.  Never mind the absolutely rude man, this place is run down in the middle of nowhere. The \"game room\" is nothing more than a couch pushed to a corner with a few unopened board games that seem to have been untouched. The beaches were close but smelled terrible. The hostel in general had no good security, was dark and there were several power outages throughout our stay. This was by far the worst hostel I've ever been too. The Thai staff, however, saved me with their smiles and their sincere worry for our comfort.  Do not stay here, go to other places in Thailand, stay away from this place.

      "40 Nice & Decent I slept in the 8 bed AC dorm. The sheets were clean, pillow was ok, towels were clean. It's a bit far from Pattaya but you can get downtown easily by paying 10 baht to songthaew drivers. John, the owner is a funny guy, who has seen quite alot in his lifetime so you can talk with him about anything. They have high speed internet, in the lobby it was good but in the dorm it was kinda slow-ish. Staff was friendly. The only thing that bothered me is that they forgot to put toilet paper in the dorm bathroom. Art D wrote a review Apr 2015\n",

Towels didn´t look clean, there was stains and there was no handtowels only bathtowels. Our AC flooded water to the floor before they fixed it. Wall \" decorations needed dedusting. Also there was lot of dust on tables and tv set. Complimentary water was served only first night. Breakfast included in our room price and it was poor only 2 slises of toast, fried egg and jam and butter. Furniture were old worn out and need desperatly to change. hola189934 wrote a review Feb 2015\n",
      "40 Owner has high integrity I recently stayed at this hotel. I paid the first night in advance with paypal and then paid the remaining 4 nights in advance at check in. I ended up checking out a day early as I had to go to Bangkok. At check out I didn't think that they would offer a refund and didnt ask. The boss offered the refund to me which I thought was honest of him and rare in Thailand. It was my own fault that I forgot to also get the key refund off him but such is life.    Its a budget hotel / hostel and thus one must not have too high expectations about whats on offer. The rooms were adequate but will soon need to be improved. I would recommend that mosquito screens be installed on the sliding glass doors to improve air circulation. The rooms do get a bit smelly to be honest.    If the 800 baht a night rooms are full at this hostel I would check across the road at the new K&J apartments for the same price as they have a kitchen in the room. But first option would be this YHA as it has a good vibe.    If you need to get your washing done... walk out of the hotel and turn left. Walk up the street towards the beach and take the first right soi. The lady on the left corner does cheap washing    cheers abooking wrote a review Jan 2015\n",
      "20 Definitely a budget hostel. Stayed in the 8 bed dorm. Shower wasn't hot, and didn't have a wall attachment. We were forced to simply rinse off instead of be able to stand under it. Lockers were broken. No screen on the balcony door.  The owners were very nice. Despite their horribly rude comments towards religion(not something you should ever say to guests). Unfortunately their recommendations weren't fit for 2 young travellers who are women.  Their restaurant recommendation was awful. Down a dark alley, with no lights, and a TON of stray dogs. The quality of the food was very poor.  While the Ladyboy show was spectacular, the area of town it was in was horrible and scary. A simple heads up about the area would have gone a long way. With the amount of scary things that happened it left an incredibly sour taste in our mouths and we won't be returning to Pattaya, or Jomtien. Very dangerous for women.  All in all, you get what you pay for. NashJM wrote a review Jan 2015\n",
      "50 Fab hostel A lovely hostel, stayed in standard double. Had television and strong wifi signal, beds are really comfortable! There was a safe, we didn't use as we didn't feel the need.  Out balcony was overlooked greenery which was lovely and peaceful, although our patio door did not lock..  The showers are hot and powerful, they do spray over the toilet and sink but that's the usual in Southeast Asia, right?  It's very close to Jomtien beach and lots of bars and restaurants. It's about 6km from the main pattaya strip, walking street and beach road but we just walked to the end of the road and hailed a truck down which are all pretty cheap, try to get one that has people on as they don't charge you as much as if your the first people on or want to go to your destination without stops.  Would definitely recommend this place. A lovely hostel! BethanJWeaver wrote a review Jan 2015\n",
      "40 Good Place I stayed at this hostel with my sister for 3 days. It's about a 5 minute walk to the beach and is close to beach road where you can find various restaurants and of course a 7-11. It's a little ways from walking street but can be easily accessed by scooter or tuk tuk.  The beds were comfortable and the hostel was relatively clean; however during our stay the room was not swept and the garbage wasn't taken out. It wasn't a huge problem with there only being 4 of us in there.  We stayed in an 8 bed dorm with air con and we're happy with our stay. There is only 1 bathroom to share for the whole room; this wasn't bad as there were only 2-4 of us in the room at a time. But I imagine if the room was full it would be a bit hectic.  The owners/managers are decent, helpful, and speak English well.  They also provide breakfast and drinks (non-alcohol) at a minimal charge). They also have scooters you can rent and have a super cheap laundry service ;)  If you're looking for cheap, clean accommodation I'd recommend this hostel. It's not close to all the craziness but it is a good place. Kpeigan wrote a review Jan 2015\n",
      "50 Excellent choice for the budget traveler I am currently staying at the Jomtien Hostel and have no inclination to move on, it is well situated close to Jomtien beach, but only a short way from the more frenetic Pattaya beach attractions.    The hostel/hotel has a wide range of accommodation, from ultra cheap dorms, which are of a higher standard of anything I have yet to encounter in Thailand, but if you have a little more money to spend they have more luxurious rooms available.    The staff are very helpful and there are motor scooters and bicycles available for hire at good prices.    If you want an excellent place to stay in Jomtien/Pattaya I happily recommend the Jomtien Hostel. geoff b wrote a review Dec 2014\n",

We had planned for sky-diving in pattaya(Thai sky adventures). The guy from sky-diving club was easily able to reach the hostel. and pick us up for the jump right from the hostel itself.    The hostel premises are very neat and clean, the room was spacious, and well maintained. It is very good deal for the asking price. John, the owner was sincerely helpful and helped us with directions and all other queries we had. They also had bike and scooter for rent available at the hotel too.  It was our first hostel stay as a couple. We have good memories to take back.  Will definitely want to come back to stay here. shubh1104 wrote a review Nov 2014\n"

If you're lucky (like we were) you may even be offered some fresh home made bread and marmelade and bananas from his farm nearby. Plus he had some great recommendations for local restaurants and a good deal on a motorbike rental.    The location on jomtien beach is less touristic, cleaner and more quiet than the Pattaya main beach, what we liked a lot.

The rooms are a great size, and have a balcony and air conditioning - perfect. The location is near the beach, whether you chose to go, but we actually sat at the pool at the Spa hotel at the corner, we just bought cocktails ;). 15min TukTuk to Walking Street at only 40baht, so for us - we'd rather stay here again to stay away from the hussle and bussle!

      "40 Clean,close to beach and inexpensive We stayed at Jomtien Hostel the night of April 21, 2014. My husband and myself had one room, and our daughter, son-in-law and 4 grandchildren had another room. The rooms were only $25 each a night. We were allowed to keep one room until 7:00 pm so the children and women could rest while the men went on an all day scuba trip. The service wasn't great, but the rooms were clean. There were no top sheets on the beds, only comforters with washable covers, so we needed to adjust the air conditioning accordingly. Racks are provided on each balcony to hang wet clothes on. Be careful about hanging things on the balcony railing. My swimsuit blew off after it was dry and fell on a roof below, over the first floor patios. The people were helpful in getting it off for us. The hostel is just 2 blocks from the beach, so was great for taking the children to the beach, then going back for a rest. The restaurants along the main beach road are more expensive, but there are a couple little places on the same road as the hostel that are reasonable (by Thai standards). The Butterfly was good, but we did not find it open for lunch. Debbie M wrote a review Apr 2014\n",

The staff are all 100% customer focused and are happy to assist their customers. The dorm room has large comfortable beds, balcony, very clean. The hostel is 2 minutes walk from the beach, great massage shops, 7/11 and a hotel swimming pool that you can use for the purchase of a beverage ;) The hostel has very affordable scooters to hire, laundry and good food/drink facilities. A kitchen they were kind enough to let me cook my own food at, a small workout/gym machine. Often had breakfast & dinners/bbqs with the staff during my stay. (1 month in 2013 & 1 week in 2014). The price of staying here is also very affordable and overall just a great atmospheric hostel! New Zealand Adventures wrote a review Apr 2014\n",

It's location is convenient true, but Jomtien beach is one of the dirtiest beaches I've been to in Thailand. The rooms themselves were good, but I met some awful people in them; I suppose that is the risk you take when you stay in a hostel. The bread was only OK and way over priced and the service was poor. The owner was not helpful at all. Whenever we asked him for recommendations, his response was always vague. Sonia M wrote a review Mar 2014\n",

Nice size room, clean and great air con.    Staff are friendly and if you speak with John or the manager, they have some great local knowledge.    Baht bus's are easy to get to and from central Pattaya for 10baht each right by the beach road.    Wouldn't really recommend the local beach, found it quite dirty, lots of rubbish over the beach and in the sea. Although a short travel can get you to a nicer one.    Only downside is someone inconsiderately left a load of dirty pots, pans and plates in the sink in the outside rooftop kitchen which quickly got infested with ants. A very clear sign is required I feel, although you would like to think common sense prevails to those who are staying there.

When you are travelling to a new place you draw certain parameters like the place to be economical(room price can be a touchy subject to begin with hehehe), clean rooms and the building, good bathroom facility and also perhaps a good view. Jomtien hostel is by far better than most hotels in the area, good bathroom and quite cheap in price.

Also the night market at Jomtien beach is only a 15mins walk and tonnes of cheap local food and souvenirs you can buy.  As for the hostel itself, the staffs are friendly and will always do their best to answer your questions. Had a good chat with the owner who never fails to give a good perspective of life. Rooms are definitely spacious and clean. Definitely the best accommodation money could buy . Sharulnizam wrote a review Aug 2013\n",
      "50 Highly recommended ! Quite reasonable price with very nice, big and clean room! Wi-fi is very strong, air conditioner works well. The staff is very friendly and helpful. John the owner is a great guy, you could talk with him endlessly. Good location, quite near the beach, you could walk to the beach and wait for a song-theo, it will take you to the walking street for 10 baht/per. Meow345 wrote a review Aug 2013\n",
      "50 Brilliant Hostel, Brilliant Staff and Owner! I booked up for 4 days, but ended up staying for 8! its in a great location, and very clean dorms, and also the most comfortable beds I have slept in whilst in Thailand, John the owner is a great guy, very funny, and very interesting. The staff are very welcoming and very helpful! Jomtien Beach is a five minute walk from the Hostel, and if you wanna go along down to the gay beach, or the beaches further down, the Baht Bus stops at the bottom of the street and will take you down that way for 10 baht.  All in all, a great hostel, I will definately come again! Lisa C wrote a review Jun 2013\n",
      "50 Excellent service and very friendly I like this hostel and highly recommend for these reason:  - First, for its location. It's only 150metres to Jomtiens beach and not so far to walking street. Not so far if you want to try bungee jumps, motorcross, paint ball.  - The room is big, very clean, included towel and safebox free, wifi is very strong with 3 hotspots. The laundry service is cheap and fast.  - The owner and all staff here are very friendly. The owner can speak English so good and he gave me very helpful information. You can feel very comfortable when sitting in front of the hostel and talking with him about everythings in the morning. He also helped me alot calling the people on phone without additional charge. I really appreciated.    The only thing that I don't like in this hostel is the number of fan, they have only 2 fans for a room, so if you don't open the door to balcony to get wind from the sea, it will be very hot in your room and hard to sleep well.

      "50 Quiet location great friendly staff Just come back after another long stay. I've stayed at is hostel 4 time now and each time I've stayed it has been most enjoyable.  Not far from the beach very clean and tidy rooms. Staff are very friendly and very very helpful.  If you want the more lively nite life it is approx 10 mins ride away on a bat bus and will cost you no more than 10 baht each way into pattaya where you will find some of the well know gogo bars and restaurants.  But if you are looking for a nice friendly cheap restaurant just walk to the bottom of the street where the hostel is turn right u will find a couple of nice friendly cheap restaurants. I would recommend the chicken restaurant excellent food and jet the owner is a warm friendly guy.  I will be staying hear again. In my opinion 4 star hotel ignore the bad comments  I would just like to add I've heard that joe the manager has left and I'm sure many people who have stayed and met joe will miss him he was a DIAMOND and a great guy all the best for the future mate. wacky1Skegness wrote a review Mar 2013\n",

      "40 Clean and big rooms The hotel is quite far from main streets of Pattaya like Walking Street, Tiffany Show or shopping malls. From the bus station (from Bangkok), it costs you 50Baht to the hotel by tuk tuk (about 10km). Just tell them you want to go to Jomtien beach, Soi 12, then they will tell you \"very far, far..\" and then it's hard to bargain. You will meet Joe, the manager there and you should ask for his phone number, he is willing to tell you where to go and how to get there. They have a lift, yes, and a very big room. We booked a double room for 3 people with an extra bed, but it seems like the room can fit more than 3. The balcony is nice, but there's nothing nice to see from there.    Service is good in general. If you are more into a quiet, relaxing place, you can choose this hotel or any other at Jomtien Beach. But if you don't have much time to relax and jst want to absorb as much as you can of Pattaya, I would recommend you stay a little bit closer to the main street.

      "40 close to jomtien beach good points:  close to the beach,clean enough, quiet,in room safe,guest friendly, internet was ok,tv with plenty of english channels, has an balcony,has a lift, breakfest was ok for something like 100 baht,the room is big, even the cheapest one, if you want your room cleaned they can do it every day, front desk speaks enough english, you can eat on the main road witch is not to far. i recommend ARMENIA about 500 from the hotel on the main road, 7 eleven close but where in pattaya you are not close>?:),price, i think it was 550 baht the cheapest room, recommend to do the booking from their site, better deal than agoda, 200 m from the main jomtien beach road,from where you can take a baht bus for 10 baht all the way to pattaya( don't pay them more than 20 baht) for 1 person.  bad points:  far from pattaya, around 20 min with the baht bus, 200 m from the main jomtien beach road and you walk on a dark street at night, but we never had any problems in 10 days we stayed at this hotel;around 1,5 from jomtien main area with bars, nobody at the reception during the night, u just get a key to enter. i would stay again if it wasn't so far from pattaya.    don't go to jomtien beach or pattaya beach for a swim, the water doesn't look to good, go to KOH LARN(coral island) razvan11 wrote a review Oct 2012\n",

      "50 clean room, nice people, good wifi connection I stayed there with my young children and sister in 2011 March, and visited again with  children and husband in December.    It's located on \"soi sarita hotel\" between soi 11 and 12.  Jomtien has its busy district in the north. So, I don't say it's conveniently located, but  it's in very quiet and peaceful area.    The room is spacious, clean, and well maintained. Nice furnitures (unlike other guesthouses  of this price range), staffs are kind, diligent, and friendly. Manager speaks good English.    Soi side rooms have view of building in front, but behind rooms facing vacant land  where a bougainvillea blooms. I enjoyed seeing sunrise from balcony every morning.    Let's talk about good points for parents. Lift is a big plus for stroller users.  Rooms (at least deluxe and superior I stayed) have dining table with 4 chairs which were  very convenient for having meals at home. In the middle of soi, there are local restaurants in the  both side. You can buy thai food there.  Hotel has a kind of curfew.  No noisy cafes in the surroundings.    Double bed was comfortable to sleep in. In addition, they provide futon (quilt) instead of blanket.  (this pleased my husband.) They provided a big towel for extra bed.  Unfortunately, extra bed sinks in and wasn't very comfortable, so we hope they consider to make  double bed + single bed room in future....    Rooms have big sofa. Delux room's sofa was so big that my sister slept in it.  There's a sink in the balcony. We bought a portable cooking stove and cooked there.  They lend rooms monthly as well, so we saw many long stayers.    I saw no Russian tourists staying in this hostel. Seems they tend to stay in hotel, not hostels or guesthouses.    There's a small store 2 doors next to this hotel, where you can buy snacks and beer.    Wifi connection was very good. I talked over skype basicly with no stress.    Beach in this area is not too crowded, compared with Pattaya or northern Jomtien area.    All in all, we met nice people in this hotel and in this soi as well. We'll definitely go back  to Jomtien hostel in our next visit to Pattaya. NNT wrote a review Jun 2012\n",
      "50 Great value, friendly and helpfull staff I was in this hotel during November and December 2011 in total 13 days.I was six nights in superior room and the other days in standard room because i made the reservation only for six days first but i would stayed longer time, but superior rooms had resevered by other travellers for that time. Both rooms are good enough, but i will prefer the superior room.  I feel the place very comfortable. It is located on a quiet area, so you can sleep well. The rooms are clean and well maintained. Staff is very helpfull and friendly. The taxi to the airport could also be ordered from hotel. The laundry service worked very well.  Overall rating is \"excellent\".

      "50 Great value & friendly staff Jomtien Hostel is at the end of a very quiet soi in the middle of Jomtien Beach. The rooms are clean and bright with a small shower room, fridge, TV, balcony and room safe and there is free, fast wifi in the room. Small doubles start at 550THB and there are dorm beds available.    Breakfast was superb, and even included fresh fruit and croissants!    The hostel is well run by a young man called Joe, and all the staff are friendly and helpful.    Recommended for travellers on a budget and who prefer peace and quiet to the madness of main Pattaya.

      "50 Great value, quiet and spotless What a result Jomtien Hostel turned out to be! It's in a very quiet location (unlike a lot of places in Jomtien), and yet only a 2 minute walk to the beach. If you really must go to Pattaya it's a 10THB songthaew ride that takes 15 minutes. It has well equipped rooms (A/C, TV, fridge, desk, free wifi that works and a small balcony), delivers an excellent value breakfast for 100THB and Joe and the team keep the place spotless. Lots of eateries nearby. It's been excellent value for our 10 night stay. 10% weekly discount making the room 495THB. Look out for Sarita and head up the adjacent Soi for around 150m. Thanks Joe and team. Itcanbedone wrote a review Nov 2011\n",
      "50 Clean & value for money I came across this establishment via the web and I was not disappointed. The room may be a little small but well appointed and everything you need including free Wi Fi (and we all need that). The tariff and the motorbike hire with helmets makes this a very attractive hotel. A great alternative to staying in Pattya with all the associated anti social behaviour. A little difficult to find first time but the landmark to look for is the Sarita hotel on the corner of Moo12 or Soi Sarita hotel.  Joe and the staff are very good and jh@jomtienhostel.com will do the trick.  Joe will give you a mobile number to call if you get lost. I hope you enjoy your stay.  The biggest factor for me was the cleanliness of the whole establishment and value for money. I have no hestitation in reccomending this hotel. Ross T wrote a review Oct 2011\n",

      "40 Cozy Hostel Decent hostel - Value for money. We, comprising a group of five members from India, stayed here in the month of May 2011. The only disadvantage advantage is, bit far from the city. There are plenty of tuk-tuks plying in the city. Hence can be easily and economically commuted to and from the hostel. The beach is very close by.    The rooms given to us exactly matched the photographs on their website. Special thanks to Mr. Joe for his kind help and guidance. The property is well maintained.    Mr. Dharanish and Dr. Purushothama were especially happy to have stayed here. We would definitely go again and recommend our friends and fellow travellers to opt this hostel if they are looking for a decent and economical hostel stay in Pattaya. sramvaidya wrote a review Jul 2011\n",

      "40 Certainly, this IS a good place to stay I have been to Pattaya already a countless number of times - yet, the Jomtien Hostel is a place to stay, I will never forget. European owned, Thai managed - it provides you a home far away from home. Khun Joe, the manager on duty here, knows what it takes to make guests from all over the world feel comfortable here. Upon check-in, one gets pampered until check-out. Khun Joe speaks English very well and obviously is very well thrustworthy. Once, I left my belongings (mobile phone and even my wallet) in my room - Khun Joe made sure, I got it back untouched. If you are seeking a clean, cozy but yet affordable place to stay in Pattaya, make sure to check out Jomtien Hostel. I highly recommend it and will return!

      "30 Nothing special, bad location but staff was alright Nobody in Pattaya seems to know the word hostel so it took me a while to find this place. When I finally got there I got a 3 bed dorm for myself which was great. Bad thing was that I needed to get trough another room with an old smelly man in there to get out and use the same bathroom as he did. No aircon, only fan.    The hostel is far away from Pattaya and it feels unsafe at night cause its in a dark alley. Once you find out how the taxi and stuff works its easy to get around.    The staff is helpfull, they helped me to book a tour and when I checked out I forgot my deposit but they didn't. There were a lot of ants in my room and some went into my laptop so it was a bit dirty. The balcony on my room was great.    All together its alright to stay here but its not very clean. The staff will help you but their english isn't that great. Great price though and free wifi. Judith wrote a review Jun 2011\n",

      "20 Not really First and foremost Jomptian Hostel is along way from main Pattaya. You can quite often get dumped short of the hostel by taxi drivers wanting to turn around. The hostel is fair, but completely spoiled by familiarity of the staff. Managerial side is excellent, but if your face is disliked by the cleaning staff, then they get away with being very rude towards you. As was my experience with the young lad that works there. I had complained about the room cleaning after requesting the service three times in one day. Apparently his girlfriend is one of the cleaners. Well that word cleaner is disputable, as there was a dead fly on the wall by the door in my bathroom when I first entered (room 405), it was still there when I left..!  I Will never stay there again, the owners need to express to the staff that there job entails being pleasant to customers (even if they don't like them), and also cleaning the room. I also didn't get offered my deposit back, and left the room exactly as I found it. Otherwise I might have recommended it. Luojie1 wrote a review Jun 2011\n",
      "30 Barely average My husband and I stayed at the Jomtien Hostel (I'm not sure how they can call it  Jomtien Hostel Hotel, as it's not a hotel) while on a larger trip around Thailand  and Cambodia. We stayed here due to the previous reviews, although  we now notice that it's overall ranking has dropped significantly.    When we arrived in Pattaya (at the bus station), no one knew where this place was,  and we had to take several different songthaew's to get there (more than what it  should have taken), so getting there was a bit frustrating. The hostel is past the  main restaurants of Jomtien Beach, and then down an alleyway (soi), near the end, by  some abandoned-looking buildings. Although there was a security guard in a booth at  the beginning of the street, by the time you reached the end where the hostel was,  it didn't feel too safe, and female travellers (especially those travelling alone)  might be best to avoid it. However the people who actually live along the soi  themselves seemed nice enough - it's very hard to tell, but doesn't initially give  off the greatest vibe in the safety department.    On the upside, the beach is very close, and Jomtien Beach is a lot quieter than  Pattaya, so if this is what you are looking for then it's a welcome relief from the crowds of Walking Street, etc. There is a 7/11 not too far up the road, so you can stock up on any amenities, and further along (about a 5 or 10 minute walk) there are many restaurants to choose from, as well as street vendors. So the location gave us mixed feelings in some sense - it was quiet, which meant it wasn't completely surrounded by things to do (you can't really get one without the other), but it wasn't really the safest area, plus the view was pretty stink. BUT, it's closed to the beach. It depends on what you are looking for as to whether you would enjoy this place, I think.    Our room was large, but needed a decent clean. There was stuff stuck to the tables  (we had to wipe them down), and the towels were really shabby. The bathrooms are not  as good as they look in the pictures, the tiles and grouting are yellowing, and we  had cockroaches in our bathroom (OK, just three, but that's three more than we'd  like). Despite the size of the bathroom, it wasn't very nice or relaxing really. The  main room itself was OK but the air con took a long time to really have any effect  due to the size of the room. There was a small fridge and a TV with some English  channels, and our room had a balcony. The bed and bedding seemed relatively clean  and comfortable, but wasn't of a considerably high standard. The guy in the room  next door to us had his TV on max volume, and was drunk and yelling all night, so it  was very hard to sleep, but once he was gone, it was a lot better - there doesn't  seem to be much sound proofing of any kind between rooms.    There is a lift, so it would suit people with disabilities, especially as the rooms  are large, and the showers are \"wetrooms\" so to speak, but I wouldn't recommend this  hostel for older people, unless they can handle the cockroaches, the overall location, and the less-than-clean rooms (rather than what you gather from the less than accurate photos on the website). In the lobby there are two computers, but you have to pay to use them (Wi Fi is free in the rooms), and there is also a small area to watch DVDs. There is  a breakfast room next door with a couple of tables, but I didn't see anyone take them up on breakfast.    We hired a scooter from the hostel, but it was a bit of a mess really - the auto  start didn't work, so you always had to put the scooter on the big stand to kick  start it, which would only really suit a taller/heavier person, or someone who knows  about scooters. They had one other scooter there but didn't seem keen to hire it  out. Service was very average and the level of English wasn't great, so while you  could usually nut out what you wanted with them, it took some time and some effort  to get the information you needed. At night time, you can only access the lobby by  swipecard, so that security issue is covered at least.    Overall, the hostel was in average condition, in an average location, with average  service. It was nothing special in the slightest, and certainly not as nice as their  website and previous reviews note. It just kind of seemed like a shabbier version of what they represent on their website. If you're used to sleeping in a cardboard box, or are on an extreme budget, the this place might seem like the Ritz, but otherwise, try somewhere else or increase your budget.

Many restaurants and all kinds of small food. 7eleven pharmacy massage etc.. In the evening if you want to sleep quiet or sit outside and have a drink, it is cozy without traffic and noise. while also giving a few minutes walk to the nearest 10 bat taxi that you can jump on every minute when you want to party or shop seriously.    The rooms are great for the price, clean and as advertised. Actually more like a hotel. The staff is very nice and does everything to make you feel good. The hotel manager even threw himself on a bike and fix things, drove us to the bus, etc..  It felt safe for children to play ball in the street and being alone in the room.

I am reporting mainly on the coffee shop, but the rooms are behind it. Looks good to. Robert Gonsalves wrote a review Dec 2018\n"

      "40 Friendly staff Stayed 2 nights in a pool villa, the room was tastefully decorated and modern the bathroom had a shower cubicle so the bathroom was no soaked after showering. The bed was really hard like most in Thailand. No safe, no kettle, there was a fridge with free bottled water daily. The pool was nice never busy which was good because there was only 2 sun loungers at each end of the pool, location is beach front the beach is not the nicest in Thailand the sea looked dirty and rough so we stayed by the pool.  Reception staff friendly and helpful although their is English was poor. sunburn15 wrote a review Apr 2019\n",

At check out there were three staff there and they didnt stop talking to each other while they checked me out. no thank you good bye nothing  Bed was hard as a rock beyourhero wrote a review Jan 2019\n"

Rooms cleaned on a daily Basis, and fresh clean towels daily although the towels are a Little old.  free wifi is available in all rooms along with Airconditioning, fridge and a safe.    less than a minuet walk from the beach and convenience stores and Restaurants.  excursions can be booked at the Hotel reception desk by the friendly owners who speak several languages.  i would definately return to this Hotel. laughingbird747 wrote a review Jan 2015\n",
      "40 Really nice place and helpful staff I stayed in the dormitory room at this hotel. It was very clean and I had the whole room to myself. I would fully recommend this hotel as a place to stay. The staff were all really nice, friendly and helpful. Located right next to the beach and about a 5 minute walk from the night market. Ceridwen88 wrote a review Aug 2014\n",
      "40 A Pleasent Place To Stay The proprietors are a lovely helpful couple, they know everything you need to know about where to go and what there is to do. It's very handy for the beach and they supply you with beach towels. Everything you need like chemist, super market etc is on the door step. The rates are very reasonable and speaking to others that where staying at the Casa Viva say they've stayed before and they'll be staying again. If we are lucky enough to get back to Thailand we would stay there again. Not a bad little spot at all, we definitely recommend it. Eddie W wrote a review Dec 2013\n",
      "50 Casa viva is a great option at Jomtien beach I have stayed at Casa viva many times as its a good hotel at Jomtien close to all the action in Pattaya- a short 10min baht bus drive away.    The rooms are all modern with comfortable beds and aircon.    The reception and cleaning staff are all friendly.    Sometimes the wifi is unreliable at casaviva but they always sort it out when advised. abooking wrote a review May 2013\n",
      "40 Lovely clean and friendly place This lovely little place is only 1 minute from the beach. The comfortable rooms are spotless, cleaned every day with clean sheets and towels daily, king size beds. Everything you need within walking distance. Free wi-fi and an adjoining coffee shop for breakfast.. Run by a very friendly and helpful couple, nothing is too much trouble for them. Highly recommended. pusscat54 wrote a review Mar 2013\n",
      "50 Will be back Please, if you want a good, clean hotel with super friendly and helpful staff, then this is it, so central to everything, only 20 baht on baht bus to Pattaya. We will definately be going back and referring Na mon and Pierre to all our friends and fellow travellers. Also free WiFi and plenty of good and inexpensive little food outlets, the best by far was 'The Garage' Debra G wrote a review Mar 2013\n",
      "50 Casaviva, Jomtien, Thailand idea for place to stay Casaviva is along Beach Road, Jomtien near Soi 12 and 50 meters from the sea. €250 per month rooms cleaned everyday and free Wi-Fi. Very nice rooms to a good standard and the area is very quite. Walk to the end of the soi and you can walk either way along 8 km of sandy beach. Plenty of places to eat and lots of 7/11's along the way. If you want the madness of Pattaya it's a €0.30 20 minute ride. They also run 24/7 and are safe to travel on. Will come back here again without doubt real value for money and the A/C is first class. nefetiti wrote a review Nov 2011\n",
      "50 tucked away from the madness We arrived having been stranded due to the volcano ash and not knowing where to go and asked the taxi driver to take us somewhere quiet, cheap and close to the beach - he took us to Casaviva Inn - we were impressed with the cleanliness and reserved a large room which was very spacious with a huge bed, tv, aircon, fridge and wifi connection. The bathroom was ample with walk in shower. No food is supplied but plenty of places to grab a bite locally. Pierre was most helpful and could direct you to where you wanted to go and knew the answer to all of our questions. You can get your laundry done just up the road, supermarket just a few steps away and the beach is close. hawkeye9 wrote a review Apr 2010\n",
      "50 Clean & large rooms My family have just arrived back from an unexpected stay at the Casaviva Inn hotel. We were delayed because of the Volcanic Ash problem which delayed our return to the UK. We arrived at Pattaya bus station and ask the taxi driver to take us to somewhere clean, cheap and quiet. He did just that. We arrived and was given a large room 302 on the third floor. There was myself, my husband and my 8 year old son. We were impressed with the cleanliness and size of the room. The hotel also has free internet access. You can also use the computer in reception free of charge. The hotel is also very close to Jomtien beach. The husband and wife team are very helpful especially in answering questions on places of interests and costs of trips etc. The only thing I would add to the rooms is a small table and chairs. Otherwise the room is very adaquate. There is no swimming pool but I took my son to the Saritta hotel which is opposite and if you buy a drink they don't mind you using the pool. There are also a Family Mart close by and a laundry service next door. Angela194z wrote a review Apr 2010\n",

We arrived early and that was no problem. Got a great room, large, clean and with everything you could want. The bathroom was spotless and that is always a good sign.

      "30 Good for its value Got a \"Superior triple\" room in this hotel during promotion from tourist company. Cheapest tour ever so I was expecting terrible conditions and prepared to move into other hotel if required.    Upon arrival we were met by hotel staff and accommodated very quickly on the second floor.    The room itself was large enough to fit 2 regular and one folding bed. Room itself is clean however there was slight smell of mold in room and traces of same in one corner of room and one corner of toilet.    Shower area is not separated from toilet area by curtain/barrier, which is very uncomfortable - always water on the floor etc.    Room itself was with balcony which we used to dry our towels.    Hotel population was mostly Russians. I think I have seen a couple of Germans but I am not sure. Even hotel reception is decorated with \"Matryoshkas\" - Russian national dolls which serves as a clear message to everyone - this hotel is for Russians.    However, unlike in other places I have been to, my compatriots were very quiet, behaving properly and not drinking. Maybe the reason for that was that hotel is relatively far from entertainment center of Pattaya and only people seeking relatively quiet rest stay here.    There are 2 large swimming pools at the hotel. Unfortunately the larger one was not working at the time of my stay but the small one is good as well. It has separate section for children as well.    There is no dedicated restaurant or bar in the hotel however breakfast is served daily 7 to 10. Regular continental breakfast and some thai food. Nothing special, average selection.    Free Wi-Fi. Portable lockbox available from reception for 500 baht. No hotel deposit.    Room was properly and promptly cleaned every day.    For cheap food - head from hotel to the right (in direction of city center) and near police box by entrance to Sigma hotel you will find small Thai cafe which makes non-spicy Thai food. Tom Yum is the most expensive item on the menu and it is only 80 baht! Everything else is even less expensive.    There is a good \"Japanese\" restaurant which you can find if you go in the opposite direction - away from city center, which, I would say, is up to european standards of service for moderate price. They serve Thai, Japanese and European food.    I would not recommend \"Seaside restaurant\" - there are 2 just next to the Isawanya on each side - too expensive and service is terrible.    Cheap laundry is on the first turn on the right from the hotel - 10 baht per piece for laundry and ironing. Roman684 wrote a review Mar 2013\n",
      "10 Mosquito plus mold and fungi...Suck Hotel Today is 18 May, 2012. I just arrived the hotel around 20.00 pm. and i found that my room was so terrible room... A lot of insects, ants and mosquito. My husband and I have to hit mosquito first before unpack stuffs.  Then, they are too much so i have to ask front to do something. The staff come to my room with insect spray can. I have to wait at the pool for 20 minutes and a lot of mosquito bite me... What the hell hotel!    I found out later that the bathroom is full of fungi and mold on the ceiling and walls. We can' t change the room because they are full. There are only 2 pillows in the room. If you want more, you have to pay 50 baht per pillow. Nanan12345 wrote a review May 2012\n",
      "10 this is not \"Hotel\" I don't understand why Isawanya dares to call itself as \"hotel\". This is extremely bad accommodation. The photograph on the website is totally different from the real. Toilet is very dirty more than you can imagine. The hotel claims in ensogo that superior room is 3,000++ baht, but from what i see, just 500 baht is maximum for this kind of room. Nothing to say except \"TERRIBLE\"!!!!!!!!

      "10 Terrible Hotel!! Isawanya Beach Resort, Pattaya = Unacceptable Isawanya Beach Resort, Pattaya, is an extremely bad hotel... The pictures and the reality are totally different. The pictures might be token last ten year ago. I'm Thai people who used to visited Isawanya Beach Resort, Pattaya. Therefore, I don't want them to lie foreigners for staying here. At first I don't know too. I paid for USD 20.00 for this room. However, when I arrived there, I was so shock. Although I had already paid for the room, I left the hotel immediately to look for other hotel because it seems like the hotel in the scary movie. The room at Isawanya Beach Resort is extremely old and smell badly especially the closet. Bathroom is very small, only 4 sqm. without separated shower zone. The water heater was damaged. If someone gave this room to me for free, i wouldn't stay for sure. At USD 20.00, I confirmed that you could find newer and better hotel than this.  โรงแรมไอสวรรยา บีช รีสอร์ท พัทยานี่อย่างห่วยเลยค่ะ รูปภาพกับของจริงต่างกันลิบลับ พอดีพลาดซื้อVoucherไปล่วงหน้าจากงานศูนย์ประชุมสิริกิติ์ โดนเซลล์เค้าหลอกมา พอไปถึงจริงๆถึงกับช็อคเลยค่ะ เหมือนโรงแรมร้างเลยค่ะ ถึงกับยอมทิ้งvoucherเลย อยู่ไม่ได้แน่ๆ สภาพโรงแรมและห้องเก่ามาก เพราะสร้างมาเป็นสิบปีแล้ว ผีจะหลอกรึป่าวก็ไม่รู้ ดูจากสภาพแล้วเหมือนโรงแรมในหนังผีเลยค่ะ ถ้าใครอยากลองของก็ลองมาอยู่นะคะ นอกจากนี้ยังเหม็นมากด้วยค่ะ โดยเฉพาะตู้เสื้อผ้า อย่าเปิดเชียว เปิดแล้วแทบเป็นลม เหม็นอับมาก ห้องน้ำนี่แย่นรกค่ะ เล็กมาก ที่กั้นอาบน้ำยังไม่มีเลย เครื่องทำน้ำอุ่นก็ดูจะพังอยู่แล้ว จะโดนไฟดูดรึป่าวก็ไม่รู้ ให้อยู่ฟรียังไม่เอาเลยค่ะ ตอนนั้นซื้อมา1,200บาท ซึ่งราคานี้ไปหาซื้อห้องที่โรงแรมใหม่ๆที่ดีกว่านี้ได้เยอะเลยค่ะ นรกมากค่ะ รับประกัน Mini2525 wrote a review Sep 2010\n",
      "20 hotel need to improve The hotel short of staff to work. And lots of mosquito at lobby. We wish to see the hotel get improve in future.Also the hotel signboard Not easy to find out. When we tell the taxi driver, they thought we are looking for the hotel at pattaya beach.Even the bell company service transport also take us to wrongry hotel when we show the map of this hotel. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Jan 2010\n",
      "20 Look for another hotel! I do not recommend this place. Look else where, trust me, it's worth paying a little more some where else.  My 2 other guests wanted to say that they agree with what I wrote. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Dec 2009\n",
      "30 Work in progress It's a good hotel at the quiet end of Jomtien beach but it is undergoing renovation.  Many hotels here in Thailand need renovation and so this is not a bad thing but these things do take time.  I think the location is good if you want a quiet place away from the noisy bars at the top end of the beach.  The staff seemed to be friendly and courteous.  There was a lot of muck behind the fridge where there was the only plug for my laptop. I put the laptop on the bed as the 'desk' was too far away. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Nov 2009\n",
      "40 jomtien quiet My room on the ground floor with pool access very nice. Construction still going on on the upper floors. Helpful staff, beautiful view from the beach, more civilized than Pattaya. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Oct 2009\n",
      "20 did not like this one this place was more like a backpacker over night say the staff where not helpfull there where there to do there job and that was it  and when you tryed to ask if they not understand you they just gave up as i wanted to move one night say and add 2more night but they would not let me so i would have lost 1 night stay and then have to pay for 3 nights so i told them that i would lose 1 night and move to other hotel and that means they lose 2 extra nights off me and it did not seam to bother them and i know if it was my hotel i would have had the 2 extra nights A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Sep 2009\n"

I stayed more than a week, I reported it after 5 days at the reception and when I left, still not done ... inadmissible francklt wrote a review Mar 2020\n",
      "20 Hard to find This place is hard to find and when you book a room here they do not tell you that you have to check in at another hotel. There are no signs for this place and the sois do not have any names on them. I got a large room BUT the toilet smelled bad due to sewer gas so I had to keep the door closed and the fan on when I was in the room. They did not use a cement sealer on the floors when they built this place so there was a water leak on the ceiling from the room above. This left a big stain and mold right over the bed. I booked this place because they said there was breakfast and I paid more per night to get the breakfast. Well the breakfast was noodle soup every day and it was the same soup every day and you could buy it for 25 THB. They DO NOT give you soap or shampoo so you have to go to 7/11 to buy some.The only good thing is this is a quiet place because there is nothing around here...very few places to eat and you are 200 meters from the beach..at least there is a 7/11 at the beach. The traffic is bad so going anywhere can take a long time...this is close to soi 12 and the night market is near soi 8 and it took 30 min on a songtow to get there. There is only 1 tree on the beach where you can sit because all the other shade areas are taken over by the vendors and you have to rent a chair. There is no elevator so you pay more for ground floor room than a room on the 5th floor. jim wrote a review Oct 2019\n"

There is 24 hour security at the resort and no nonsense parties or drunks shouting at night. There is a Family Mart convenience store less than 10 minutes walk away. If you wish to explore the area but be able to return to somewhere peaceful and relaxing at the end of the day Laguna Beach 3 is the perfect spot! Mr John wrote a review Aug 2019\n",

I am writing to complain about my staying in Inrawadee resort. couldn't imagine that my staying in this hotel would be so bad.  Low air condition, dirty and there's plenty of insects and bugs in the room.  Disturbed by noise from the other room.  I absolutelly will not recommend this hotel to anyone,futhrmore!!!

      "20 A nearly place This resort looked to have everything we would need for out break. This for us included the fact that they allow pets. The resort itself is out of the way and a fair distance from the beach or centre. Accommodation is in wooden chalets in nice wooded grounds, there was a pool and a reception come restaurant / bar which basically hardly opened. This is why I titled this a nearly place, here is a resort, somewhat out of the way with some nice areas to eat and drink in but they are closed. You are forced to do it yourself (which we did one night cooking on the decking by our chalet) or go into town. As most restaurants in town don't like you taking dogs with you there were a number of unhappy dogs locked in chalets whilst their owners went out.  Could be good but poor.

      "10 Bugs, Lack of English and Scary I stayed at Inrawadee Resort for 3 nights and did not have a good experience. The staff did not speak English so anything we needed, like clean towels, help in finding a restaurant or booking a taxi to Bangkok we were not able to do through the hotel. There was the biggest spider I´ve ever seen (apart from the ones in zoo´s) in our bathroom. There were cockroaches all over our bed. Somebody tried to break into our room in the middle of the night which was scary because the doors and windows don´t properly close. Overall it was a terrible experience. N R wrote a review Jul 2013\n",
      "20 Did stay only one night, will not go back Ok, the staff is very nice and helpfull. They drive you to the beach if you want to.  But, the rooms are very very basic and small. All in wood, it makes a lot of sound when walking around. The door and windows does not close perfectly.  I booked for 5 nights but only managed to stay one night.  I felt so lonely and depressed.  There is nothing around. Just a long, small road with dogs, barking and following your tuktuk when arriving there.  The place is quite nice, but do not go there if you want to see a lot of people and do a lot of stuff. Go there if you like to be all alone on yourself. Dimitri L wrote a review Apr 2013\n",
      "10 Spiders, cockroaches. Theft from room. No English speaking staff, attempted 2am room break in. Worst place we've ever stayed. Where to begin. Well we first entered the room to see a dead cockroach, in the evening a live one crawled across the bed then disappeared. The next morning the biggest spider I've ever seen was in the shower. My pocket swiss army knife was stolen from the room and they ate lots of our cookies, unbelievable. At 2am someone tried to get in the room, my girlfriends screaming scared them off but only after a full minute of terrifying door rattling. If your life depends on it don't stay here! Stay in the woods or on the beach, anywhere just not here. Really can't believe no one speaks a word of English either. Don't stay here! Wanderingsouls1 wrote a review Dec 2012\n",
      "50 Perfect , quiet location , friendly staff and a very cute dog !! We stayed for 6 weeks at the resort , sometimes we were the only people there- it got busier at weekends. The bungalows are little wooden huts with aircon- but not in the bathroom. The shower was very good - plenty of water, The reception staff were very friendly. Thanks Jo ! The bungalow was serviced every day so you had fresh towels and clean sheets which was very welcome. The staff were very friendly - one family lived on site near the pool. We hired a motorbike while we were there but it is only a short walk to the main road then you can get a baht bus along the coast road to Pattaya for only 10 baht - great value and to get back the taxi bikes are great fun- you can haggle the price down. In the bungalow you have a safe - you set the code for it. There is a fridge for your drinks and food and we got a bowl from reception - so each morning we had ceral and friut on the veranda and at night - before we went out we had a few drinks- If you but the mossy curls from the 7 eleven shops they keep them at bay. There is a very cute dog we named maisey- she answer to anything really as she is Thai !! The pool was really nice- very clean but take care as you get in - there is a surpise - underfoot !! We will stay there again - Jo has some of our clothes- we ran out of space as we bought stuff to take back !! Apart from that it suited us down to the ground - bu we are very easy going and take everything in our stride - lifes to short to be hung up on stuff - If you want things like at home - stay at home . Thailand is a place to experience and enjoy and never judge- everyone has to survive and live somehow. Enjoy xx LesleyDunn09 wrote a review Mar 2012\n",
      "30 Very far from the beach We stayed at Inrawadee resort for the week end. The rooms are very simple and basic (small huts) but decorated with a lot of taste. The bathrooms are very badly designed with no space between the water closet and the sink. We did not suffer from mosquitoes although there were holes in the wooden floor. We however slept like babies because the resort is located in a quiet & remote area.    The main problem was that the beach (Jomtien) was relatively far from the hotel (20 minutes walk) with no transportation organized by the hotel. When going to the beach we had to walk first on a small and dangerous road (no side walk) and then on a bigger street. On the way back we used to take local tuk-tuks (song tao) but they would stop at the intersection between the main street and the small road of the hotel, therefore we had to come back walking which is not only very pleasant after a whole day on the beach. valschmitt wrote a review Feb 2011\n"

Was greated at the airport with a private taxi, taken to the hospital and after the PCR test we were taken to the hotel.    The hotel room was very big and airy and the bed was extremely comfy.

The show was fabulous every night,the drinks were excellent and the price reasonable., Very polite and friendly waiters and staff.

      "50 Convenient, inexpensive, with a showtime. The hotel was just a few blocks from the beach. It was on an enclosed street with numerous restaurants and bars. The hotel, and I rented only a small room, was attractive, and one enters the room and towels are fashioned into swans, it is attractive. Black and dark blue were the dominant colors, but in the day there was a large window with a scenic view toward the beach. There was a table and chairs, and a larger chair to relax. The bed was large. Despite the black color of the bathroom, the bright lights made all visible. Shower, hot water, western toilet. There was an elevator, but a small. attractive spiral staircase.  The best perk of the hotel was the cabaret. Initially, I had read that the rooms would not be disturbed by the show on the ground floor. That is true. The night I did not go, I did not hear it and I was on the 2nd floor. Since I was in the hotel, I decided to go to the cabaret (in the hotel's lobby) for one drink (there was a discount), but I did not expect to stay long. Changed my mind once I saw the show. Fun. Decided to go again also. The hotel is convenient, inexpensive, with a safe, and with a show. Worth a visit and a return. Hugh M wrote a review Jan 2019\n",
      "50 Superb rooms friendly staff Just finished a two week stay here at the Venue in Jomptien complex.    Moved here after disappointing original hotel.  Arrived and had fast and smooth check in by a smiling young man, was shown to my room and what a surprise if I could have designed the decoration it would have been the same, sort of contemporary Japanese , black and white, with nice artwork on walls.  Bathroom had everything you needed including constant hot water.    Being smack in the centre of jomptien boys town your only steps from a multitude of bars and restaurants , the gay section of Dongtan beach is only a five minute stroll away.    If you want to go into Pattaya it's only 10 baht by local baht taxi, hundreds of them just wave.    And of course must mention the Venue ladyboy show that starts around 9.45 and is great fun with an amazing troop of performers, if not a late night person don't let the thought of a show downstairs put you off, I had a few early nights and although the show was in progress I had to strain to hear anything.    If your looking to book a full service hotel, one that you can go down and order or have breakfast, or while away the day on the terrace this may not be for you as essentially your booking a nice comfy room with nice staff, it does have a small pool to cool down in, but not big enough to do any major swimming.    Would return as so friendly. Chesterguy wrote a review Jul 2018\n",
      "50 A fantastic place to stay I have been coming to Thailand for over 20 years and I'm on a budget that means I am not looking for the cheapest accommodation but certainly can't afford the big chains. I have been really lucky with my finds in the past, such as the now closed, Flamingo Hotel in South Pattaya. This is my first stay at the Venue and I must say it is the best I've ever stayed in. The standard of the room is 1st class, spotless clean, a nice fresh feel to the room, beautifully presented, excellent bathrooms and total value for money. The manager, Chris, is also 1st class and you can see that he takes pride in his work. I am a gay solo traveller and the location is perfect, 5 mins walk to the beach and shops, bars, restaurants etc are within an easy walk. Pattaya itself is only 10 minutes away, using the regular baht buses. Back to the Venue itself, I can't praise it enough and the attention to detail makes such a difference, everything from the welcoming towel folding, as in the pic, to the kettle and free tea/coffee available, to the FREE bottle water (which is such a plus to have in your room and needed in Thailand). The rooms are big , with good storage and a safe provided. I won't stay anywhere else now, in the Pattaya Jomtein area. Stephen S wrote a review May 2018\n",

      "30 Get what you pay for Spent a few nights here on a recent holiday. The positives: Cheap! Large size room, close to the beach and bars. A/C worked great, wifi worked great.  Cons: It's pretty much self service. They don't really employ anyone to deal with guests. They have a cleaning crew during the day that responds to requests and at night someone who works the show takes care of guests. WHen I checked in about 7:30pm, the young man who had to do this was quite unfriendly and seemed annoyed that he had to take time from the show rehearsal to handle me.  The place is also kind of a dump. My room was cleaned well everyday, but this place hasn't seen new furniture since 1986. The second day I was there, the ceiling came down because of a leak . Took them 2 days to fix. DO NOT look too closely at the fittings in the lobby. Decades of dust and dirt.

      "30 Disapointed I have written quite a few times on The Venue. I stay there most years because íts convinient and walking distances to the beach and bars. This year i was deeply disapointed because it felt rundown. Also some staff were nôt very friendly . I give you an example. Normally when a quest has a drink you just put it on the bill. I was told they dobt do this anymore because it only trickers arguments. I just didnt felt the same service as i did before. Its a hotel and a guest should feel important and want to be treated as being important.  I might not stay there this year. Pitty. Stephan W wrote a review Mar 2017\n",
      "50 Interesting place We had a great time at the venue. Drinks were fairly priced, no entry fee.  Dancing and the singing was very very good  The wives had the Pinacolafa's. Very nicely made.  We were 2 couples and this venue is great for all adults. Dennis L wrote a review Jan 2017\n",
      "20 What happened?! Over the years we have stayed and The Venue and regularly attended the shows.    Whilst they were not to the same scale as the more lavish productions in Pattaya, the crowd were always pleased and the cast performed 'full out'    Upon our return this year we found that the show was very stilted and very underrehearsed. There were lots of very young male dancers who were clearly struggling to remember routines and looking at in another to see what move came next    800 BHT for 3 vodkas and a Chang beer is also very pricey. The chairs in the cabaret room are horrifically uncomfortable and we all left during the second part of the show with painful backs.    All in all totally forgettable and disappointing. A great shame as we enjoyed it so much in previous years EntsManJon wrote a review Jan 2017\n",
      "40 Good value for money Good rooms, spacious. Nice bathroom. You can feel its a cabaretshow mainly with some rooms and a pool attached. Staff is friendly but not very interessted. Pool is small and not much sun. But the beach is close. Jacuzzi was not working. But for the money very good Kulevliet wrote a review Dec 2016\n",
      "50 Very Comfortable Rooms And First Class Service I have visited the showbar many times over the years but this is my first stay at the hotel. Having now spent time here it makes me wonder why I've taken this long.    I made a last minute enquiry about room availability and received an immediate reply from the Assistant General Manager, Chris. I was offered a very acceptable rate for a 10 night stay and I was more than happy with this. The hotel offers three categories of room, all with similar features. The only significant difference being the physical size of the room. Rooms have a nice large bed which is incredibly comfortable and I have enjoyed some wonderful nights slumber. Whilst the hotel is situated in the heart of the Jomtien Complex, which is one of the main bar and nightlife areas, there was zero disturbance with noise. The hotel's own Caberet ends by midnight and all is peaceful afterwards.    There is a strong wifi signal and good range of television programmes available on a flat screen TV. A DVD player is also in each room. A nice sized bathroom joins into the bedroom, with attractive Asian style sliding doors. There was no issue with hot water supplies and fresh towels are provided daily, along with beach towels.    The hotel is in walking distance of Dongtan gay beach and does predominantly cater for the more discerning gay guest. Other Jomtien beaches can be reached on foot or by hailing the Baht bus on the main road, for a standard fare of 10 Baht. When getting to the end of the road, left is the straight area, left the gay part.    Guests currently receive 20% discount off their show time bar bill, which is a nice gesture. Bar rates are very reasonable when you consider there is no cover charge for the nightly shows that run pretty much back to back between 22:00 and midnight.    The Venue is a hidden gem of a hotel, with the current management getting things very right in providing quality accommodation at a fair price and with excellent entertainment. I spend about 100 nights a year travelling the world and The Venue has become one of my favourite places to stay. Robin_K wrote a review Nov 2016\n",
      "50 Great rooms, great staff and room cleaning I went to Jomtien for the first time and stayed at The Venue. perfect choice, the room was large and spacious and had all you wanted in it, with an great shower. The room cleaning with excellent with lovely staff. The owner/manager was so helpful in advising me where to go and how to get a bus to Bangkok and just very friendly and chatty. My only concern was that of security, people could often just come in and get in the lift to the floors with no ID taken and no phone call after to check all was OK, so there is a safe in the room, just deal with your own security. Other than this I had a great stay, I will defiantly be back to stay at The Venue and probably with some regularity. Phil C wrote a review Sep 2016\n",
      "40 Great entertainment every night! Stayed here a number of times over the years. The floor staff and waiters are very freindly and the show is a must see.... The price of the rooms have come down somewhat, but the quility of service is still up there in the 7/8 out of ten mark! Gerry L wrote a review Sep 2016\n",
      "50 Nice place for a drink Passed by last night with friends for a cocktail, they have a set of 3 shows per night and change constantly. Staff is very friendly and drink prices are reasonable, the drinks have good taste and strong to Thailand standard. The shows are great, the \"girls\" are doing a good job as well as the dancers. Choreography and clothes are also great. This is a nice place for a after dinner cabaret visit, after the show the \"girls\" and dancers walk around and say thank you it's a great opportunity to give a small tip if you enjoyed the show. It's a nice way to show appreciation. Venue is on my list of places every time I visit Pattaya and jomtien. Oscar M wrote a review Aug 2016\n",

      "40 Excellent value for the price. You aren't likely to find any accommodation this good for this price point. The location is great if you want to be in the middle of the action. the rooms are well appointed and spacious enough. The staff were all very friendly to us. When I paid 950 Baht I figured it would be some flop house. I looked at the room and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. There are other places near this price range that you would not even consider staying in for just 100 Baht less. I can't stress enough how comfortable and how good of a value this place is.    My air con worked very well and my room was like a freezer if I put it on low. The only thing that I didn't really like is the atmosphere of the bar in the morning. It looks like what it is and that is a night club that is basically closed or looks closed. I didn't feel like I wanted to hang out there and have a coffee in the morning. I am not sure what could be done to make this a bit better. I really, really, really dislike the choice of chairs they have.    When I was watching the show I was uncomfortable after about 20 minutes and noticed the guy in front of me had his arm behind his back to brace against the chair. They eventually brought him a pillow to use. I finally left just because of the chairs being uncomfortable. I own a guesthouse myself and can appreciate that it is a big expense to replace chairs when you need maybe 100 of them or so like the venue has.    However maybe they could slowly phase in some better chairs over time. A thought I just had is maybe even offer a VIP ticket and you get a very nice sofa or something like that. Charge a small premium for the seating to to cover the cost of the sofa. Just an idea but I really can't enjoy the show there which is actually a really good show because of the seating. The compact tables I completely understand because of space issues but better chairs don't take up more room. Not sure my idea of sofas would work because of space constraints but was just throwing an idea out there.    Anyway sorry to ramble on but over all it is a very good package if you stay here.

      "20 Anonymous Guest I stayed at The Venue in 2011 and was very impressed. I could tell immediately that the owner was English and standards / service were very good. Unfortunately this year I felt very disappointed that both of these elements had slipped significantly.    On our last visit we were greeted upon arrival, as we got out of the car. We were sat down and given a cool towel and complimentary juice and a very chirpy chap took us through the registration process and then took our cases to the rooms.    None of this happened happened this time around, from the off we were saying 'this feels different'. We stood at the bar to fill in the registration forms. There was no common civilities as our passports were taken for photocopy. We took our own cases to the rooms.    I had a junior suite which was very spacious. However the decoration was tired and needs attention. There was water running through one of the light fixtures above the bed and the air conditioning unit was old and very very noisy. I checked the filters to give me an indication of when the unit was last serviced, they were caked with dust. The unit was located directly above the pillows and would, at regular intervals, drop water and ice onto me as I slept. I had to buy earplugs to be able to sleep.    The housekeeping service was excellent with fresh linen and towels every day, but the staff make an unholy racket when servicing the rooms, so there is no chance of resting when they're working.    I was most disappointed by the attitude of one of the reception staff. There was never a smile or hospitable greeting and room keys were thrust forward each time without any communication. In fact that really sums up my stay. Our two rooms cost just over £700 for two weeks, which is reasonable for westerners; however the total lack of interaction with staff and management made me decide that I would not book this accommodation again. The owner would make eye contact daily, then ignore us. Very strange behaviour, it left us thinking that we had perhaps done something wrong.    My last gripe is that I was over charged for drinks from the bar, which perversely are twice the price of the drinks in the mini bar! Go figure! EntsManJon wrote a review Jan 2016\n",
      "40 Good entertainment for the price of a drinl This review relates to the cabaret rather than the hotel. The entertainment is dancing (much of it very good) and lip sync \"singing\". A mix of male dancers and \"singers\" and ladyboy \"singers\" and dancers. Costumes are often lavish and the choreography is imaginative. Three shows are offered each evening and the routine varies daily. No entry fee and drinks are, in my view, reasonably priced. Many people go very regularly. I find once a month enough but each to their own. Worth a visit in my view Ian F wrote a review Jan 2016\n",
      "40 Great place and great value for money This is not my first trip to the Venue and I have already booked for June this year. This is a great place to stay. Located right in the heart of the Jomtien Complex and very close to all the bars, restaurants and the beach is only 5 minutes away. I had one of their suite rooms which was large, stylish and very clean. The staff were great. Friendly and very helpful. The room had a large double bed, safe, sofa, dining table and chairs, TV and wardrobe and enough storage space for all my clothes. It's also has a mini bar fridge and room in there for your own bits as well. 2 free bottles of water are also supplied daily. There is also a. Swimming pool and sun loungers to relax during the day if you don't fancy the beach    Downstairs their is a nightly ladyboy, cabaret show which was a lot of fun. We spent Christmas Day evening at the show and throughly enjoyed it.    Looking forward to going back in June as this place is exceptional value for money. BoboBrighton wrote a review Jan 2016\n",
      "50 A fun, fast moving and more than enjoyable show. While in Pattaya I had gone to Alcazar and the show there as folks said a must see. It was OK but nothing fantastic and it was a long night for me.    As I was staying in Jomtien close by at VT 5C and had walked by the location of the Venue show and noted the times, we decided to give it a try.    And I so enjoyed myself and a very close up front seat made it all the more enticing.  And the price point of buying at least one 150 B drink was more than fair and if a couple of more were added plus the two for one offer made it all the more of great value.    And the show itself while campy at times, and some rookies in the cast had some missed kicks, it was still great. While at Alcazar I nodded off, but not here as it was over before I knew it. It held my interest the whole time.    And as I am so out of sync with the music world, I have to admit a first time for an Adele song and it was awesome and made me want to hear more of her music.    I enjoyed the show so much I even went back for a second time as just a 4 minute walk for where I was staying, but I would have taken a cab ride to return if I had to.    And I liked the business vibe to the operation as no hustle on buying drinks or the such.    I would give the Venue my highest recommendation and when I Pattaya, be sure to give it a try.

I had a room on the 4th floor (there is a lift) with a balcony. Noise at night was not a problem because of the local laws most place have to close at 1 am. Downstairs is a cabaret which is at 9.30pm every night, rest of the time the bar is quiet. Only a small pool but good for cooling down and sitting by in the day time.

The room was big and clean and well equipped with water boiler, mini-bar and 4 free bottles of water/day.    The bed was nice to sleep in and the room was quiet.. You could hear some sounds only during the cabaret (2 hours) and since you normally watch the very good ladyboy cabaret with many beautiful dancers the sound would not be a problem. The cabaret also ends before midnight.    Both checkin and -out was handled fast and easy. and I found the staff very friendly and observant.    For me the wifi is very important and it worked perfectly throughout my stay. There could be some delays during the cabaret due to many visitors.    This is a place where I can stay again. gelGoE wrote a review Sep 2015\n",

      "50 again an excellent stay @ The Venue! In november of 2014, me and my partner stayed again for 4 nights in The Venue Hotel and Cabaret.  Just as the numberous times we stayed here before, this stay was again excellent!  The rooms of The Venue are allways very clean, the staff is friendly, and it's prime location, just 5 min walk to the beach, is perfect!  Although they dont serve any foods @ The Venue, this is no problem, because you can take an excellent breakfast, lunch or dinner just minutes walking from the hotel.  The daily cabaret show they perform in The Venue is from a high standard, and definitely a must do when you are in Jomtien!  A nice tip: go and sit by the pool of the hotel around 4 or 5 'ish, order a glass of wine at the hotel bar (happy hour then!!) just next to the theatre where the boys are then rehearsing their cabaret show... You will love it!  As I said before in my previous reviews of The Venue, this place is still the place to stay when you r in Jomtien, Pattaya!  Thank you very much to the whole team of The Venue for again a perfect stay in Thailand!!  Keep up the good work! wickey wrote a review Dec 2014\n",
      "40 Very satisfactory--but not without qualification... My third visit--always pleasant, especially when booking an outside-facing room. The Venue is especially a good deal when the 50% discounts are in effect--which is most of the time. There are, however, some caveats: 1) The nightly show is loud throughout, even in the supposedly sound-proofed areas of the hotel. Do not plan on being asleep much before midnight. 2) The air conditioners are old, noisy, and severely challenged. They work--but take quite a while to get up to speed. 3) Water pressure in the shower is low. 4) While they do excellent jobs cleaning the room, maids don't get around to it until well into the afternoon. Either forget about taking an undisturbed nap or forget about having your room cleaned. Moreover, hallways are small and narrow; the girls carry on loud conversations as they work. 5) You will be an anonymous guest. Nobody, including the receptionist hiding in a back office, gives a fig whether you are enjoying yourself. 6) No breakfast (or any other meal) served--but alternatives are available nearby. Highly recommended is Linda's--more or less across the street. MGBIndonesia wrote a review Dec 2014\n",
      "30 Everything but a personality! I spent a week in a suite and it was as most others describe, but I found a nightly problem with muskeetos in my romm that kept me up most nights. During the entire week I didn't find a single person working there that was friendly enough to even say hello. Messages left for me were never delivered. Phone calls made to my room were never on the line when I answered. There is no one to complain to that speaks English. There pool is in the shade and not used by any guests. As I was leaving and waiting for my ride I had a first conversation with a young Thai who said he was the manager, but he was also the bellboy, cashier and worked the Cabaret at night. With 15 rooms, there should be someone experienced to respond to guests needs. NO, I would not stay at this facility again. The Cabaret is free and open to everyone with a very professional show having eight cute dancers. Unfortunatly they don't put the same effort into the hotel. mel h wrote a review Nov 2014\n",

The Venue showed available and I decided to give it a try. I am really glad I did. Not only is it quite reasonable but the rooms are great. I stayed in a junior suite. It was large, very bright and quite comfortable. The bathroom was very nice with a large walk in shower. I would definitely stay there again. They also have a very good cabaret show downstairs every night of the week. Note the hotel caters to mostly a gay clientele but is welcoming to everyone.

The rooms are well presented, clean, with large king/queen size beds, walk in shower, basin + toilet with spray.  There are tea/coffee making facilities, DVD player/TV, a free combination Safe, powerful Air Con & Great WiFi!.  I really enjoyed my stay here. All the staff were very friendly & welcoming. There were always fresh towels & many bottles of water when I returned from the beach (just 3 mins walk away) each day.  The Cabaret is fun, different every night & if you want more entertainment after midnight you can ask one of the staff/dancers for a lift into town, they might even join you!  The pool is a little small for swimming, but with the beach so close this wasn't a problem.  I highly recommend the Venue for a great value stay in Jomtien. PTTurner wrote a review Jul 2014\n",

For a modest fee of 1500 baht, it iwas modern and stylish with an appealing decor. The rooms were well equipped, comfortable and well maintained. The staff and service was friendly and to top it all was this fantastic nightly cabaret show that never failed to entrance the audience. All in all the place exuded an air of freshness, vitality and comfort. Furthermore, the location, at the heart of Jomtien complex and minutes away from the gay beach, would be hard to beat.

      "50 Thank You From James November 2013 Having been a frequent visitor to Pattaya in previous years and staying in hotels and private accommodation, this was my first time in a boutique residence.  I was extremely comforted on my arrival, by the excellent presentation of the Junior Suites. They were very clean and the furnishings had been thought through very well. Plenty of bottled water supplied every day. AND there was no noise from the cabaret, but then I didn't go to bed before 12 o'clock. I wasn't disappointed by the lack of breakfast being supplied, as there are so many options in and around Jomtiem complex to compliment your stay. Only the smallest of comment was that the bed was a bit hard, but saying that, I did have great nights sleep (perhaps that was the booze). If I return to Pattaya will I stay here again, MOST definitely. The shows are always very good and a great complement to the stay, if you don't want to go very far for entertainment.  And all this with the added good value for money. James B wrote a review Dec 2013\n",
      "30 Unexpected Surprise Decor great, show very good with great energy, service was average and drinks slightly over priced. It's kind of a retro bar with a drag show, we did not stay for the three shows however the First shw was pretty good. Once I realised what was going on I found that this atmosphere was not fr me however there were plenty of people enjoying. The shows are free and there is no cover charge.

      "30 Basic Pleasant rooms but don't expect great service. I arrived and the room safe was curiously not attached with bolts to the wall. I had to wait for the helpful manager to get someone to come up and bolt it to the wall. He explained that there was some renovation or something. Otherwise, it's hard to understand why that wouldn't have been done long before.    There was no pool when I was there. Construction was happening. Manager seemed to think this was not something that I should be concerned with even though the website said there would be a pool.    There's no breakfast. Places are nearby and I had mediocre experiences with them.    Room service is slow. Even when you say that you want the room done by a reasonable time, such as 2 p.m., it still takes them a long time to get the single two-person room-service team to get to your room. If you have a visitor, this can be annoying.    The show in the downstairs bar is good. And, if you stay in the room you have wifi so you can use the wifi during the show.    Place has a rustic elevator and an elegant Montreal-like spiral staircase to upper-floor rooms.    I paid around US$50, so the question that has to be levelled against the above critiques is, \"Is it worth it?\"    There are cheaper places nearby. The room I had was nice, though. It had a balcony and a view of the tall tower nearby. Air conditioning worked and the bathroom was nice.    Not having breakfast made it more difficult to meet other guests although I did meet one and wound up taking a taxi with him to Bangkok for both of our next stays. So, it is possible to meet other guests.    No noise later at night and the bed was good. Glen K wrote a review Sep 2013\n",

When we arrived the hotel staff where practically asleep at the front counter and then had extreme difficulty locating our reservation (which had been quite an ordeal to book in the first place). My room smelt of smoke and the bed sheets looked as if someone had recently populated their Pattaya experience all over them. Staff were friendly but the overall experience was average. I would recommend to stay in a serviced apartment in Pattaya as hotels in this range are rather average. J R wrote a review Aug 2013\n",

Room is very nice appointed, Houskeeping doing a great job and reception staff is very friendly.    When my airline did not deliver my suitcase upon arrival, they made many phonecalls during the same night and the next day to have the delivery organised.    All of this for a great deal during low leason. As other writers complained, after midnight its dead quiet and I had a great sleep until lunchtime...

The rooms are well appointed with a mini bar, safe, plenty of towels for use for both shower and beach. Good AC, tea n coffee making facilities, free water, complementary toiletries.    Room rates, mini bar and the in house show bar are very reasonable.    The nightly evening show starts at 10pm and is performed and rehearsed well by the performers.    The staff are efficient and upon check in I was given an extensive tour and explanation of room and facilities. They clearly show they want their guests to be comfortable and enjoy their stay.    The location is safe and secure, walking distance to beach, plenty of bars n restaurants within stones throw.    I am a regular visitor to the area and this is my first stay at The Venue, I am angry as I have stayed at so many overpriced unfriendly alternative hotels and only just found The Venue as what will now become my preferred hotel, I shall be returning for sure.    I normally stay at Le Cafe Royal in Boyz Town but would suggest that this area has now become too commercialized and you will constantly be harassed for tips and sexual services. Staff in this area are rude and have attitude problems. Worth visiting but I suggest stay within Jomtien Complex as much friendlier and half the prices for hotels, restaurants and drinks.    Be sure to check out the following local restaurants:  1) Linda's Restaurant - great food with great menu and evening entertainment. Breakfasts from 99thb  2) Steve's Fish n Chips  Cod, chips n mushy peas 200thb Travel wrote a review Jul 2013\n",
      "40 good and friendly stay i did stay at the venue for 2 weeks holiday, the hotel nice and clean, the staff always cherfull and look after the guest so nicely, nothing to much for them to make your stay enjoyable, the hotel clean and a bit noisy at the night but if you stay in cabaret hotel don,t expect silence and peacefull stay.    no bar and restaurant for breakfast at the morning, they start to work around 04.00 at the afternoon and that a bit enoying sometime.    We have a good time and will go again for sure YorkJohnny wrote a review May 2013\n",
      "50 probably one of the best Hotels in Jomtien Beach No words to say how much i have valued their service from the time i stepped in to the hotel until my departure. The Manager Mr. Kittisan knows exactly how to handle clients, how to attend to their needs with his politeness and kindness. The rooms are spot clean, comfortable beds, new linen, nice cosy small bathrooms.They say you get 02 bottles of mineral water for a day free of charge but i always had over 4 bottles in the room.such was their attentiveness. The staff is so professional, excellent attitudes, good small swimming pool to be on your own any time of the say. This pool got a good jacuzzi.  the cabaret show in the evening starting at 2200 hours is one of the best i have seen by lady boys. If you visit Jomtien beach, dont miss out this show. Its worth spending an hour there to see this. Drinks are so damm cheap compared to most of the other places.  This is just 5 mnts walk to the Jomtien or Dongtan beach. Lots of good restaurants around. You can surely feel at home with such nice staff of the hotel around you.  The rates are so cheap compared with same standard hotels in that area.  they can be easily rated as 3* + in any standard. Mano S wrote a review Apr 2013\n"

      "40 Venue = Friendly and Efficent A small hotel above a cabaret bar, no problem with noise the bar closes at 12:30 except on exceptional nights like Christmas and New Year.  Large beds, lots of water in the shower, TV and DVD player.    OH yes.... a lift (Americans please read Elevator) jinks0000 wrote a review Feb 2013\n",
      "40 Good location The hotel is in Jomtien Complex, close to many excellent restaurants and night life. Service was friendly and the room was nice style and very clean - even the balcony floor was spotless. There is no restaurant. Minibar prices are cheap, and there are 4 complimentary bottles of water daily. EspooFintravel wrote a review Feb 2013\n",
      "50 Comfort in Chaos Now boys and girls if you Know Jomtien complex, you will know that it is a sort of run down, chaotic, noisy area. Step through the entrance of The Venue and you can leave all that behind and relax in Comfortable and affordable elegance.    No, The Venue is not a 5 star hotel but then again neither are its rates but you will certainly be treated like a 5 star customer.    No, The Venue is not a major hotel \"Giant\", it has a guest house feel to it where you will most definitely feel like a welcome guest.    Beautifully decorated spacious rooms, Clean sheets and towels every day, Tea & Coffee provided in the rooms, Flat screen TV & DVD player, Mini bar, Beach towels changed daily, Air con, well stocked toiletries, and all for under 30€ a night for two people, you cant really ask for more can you ?    Downstairs every night is the show bar where you will be entertained with a high quality fast paced and spectacular show. Don't worry about the noise, it finishes well before midnight so you will get your beauty sleep....Oh yes, Beauty sleep. We all need it and you will sleep soundly in a very comfortable, Large bed with quality bedding !    As I said before, Not a \"Hotel Giant\" but most certainly walks with the giants where quality and value for money are concerned. LadyDiamondS wrote a review Feb 2013\n",
      "30 Needs food. Ive just stayed at this 'hotel' for 9 nights after arriving a few days earlier than expected. I booked a Junir Suite and was told i had one, it turned out i didnt, but i was offered what i was told was a 'special rate' it might have been for a suite but not for the room i received, however, it was sufficient to stay for the amount of time, the mini bar was quite cheapish, but everything was OUT OF DATE, i told reception but in 9 days nothing happened to it, not my problem its just i would have drunk it dry everyday so they only lost out on money. i went to one of the many millions of 7 elevens and saved even more.    there is no food on site which is a shame they have plenty of room for a nice continental brekky area.    never used the tiny pool/terrace.    the house keeping staff are amazing, they really looked after me and vice versa, even got a lovely thank you and hug on my check out.    The show.... well it is you would expect, miming!! except for one guy who something live, which was very nice... its all big colourful costumes (on the lead mimist) but entertaining to watch, however they say there is no cover charge but jeez you are stung for a bottle. 130 baht for a singha, other bars charge between 40-60 baht so effectively you are being charged but it is hidden in the drinks prices, and then after the show they hang around for tips.    the service staff are nice, one didnt smile the whole time i was there, he needs to go. but the others are brill and nice and funny.    The hotel is 5 mins from the Beach, and Baht Buses are 2 mins walk away which is very handy to pattaya 10-20baht depending how far you travel. twice they tried to rip me off, he asked for a hundred.. i soon told him where to go, he said he would call the police i said 'fine, i will wait' he drove off.    i was looking forward to a nice chat with the owners but never got to see them unfortunately.    there is a really nice local restaurant called 'spring onion' its sooo cheap for lovely delicious Thai food and they will make the food to your liking with the spices. up to 80 baht for curry and rice.    I would stay here again it was nice, and peaceful. even with the show on you couldnt hear an awful lot and i was on the 3rd floor.    Enjoy your stay but dont expect an awful lot..    there is a lovely restaurant on the beach road called Akvavit about 10 mins from the hotel, it is a must and is advertised on channel pattaya one. find it and have a nice evening.    they are doing hotel rooms to a very high standard soon, so i will be checking it out. The owner and Executive chef is called pelle pettersson and makes it his pride to welcome you. Hotel_traveller32 wrote a review Dec 2012\n",
      "20 Not a hotel and nothing special at all and at night very noisy...not a place to relax. The only reasons one stay there is if one like nightlife and this place is not a hotel (no good facilities) and should not be listed under hotels. It's a guest house in a noisy entertainment area and room was also very noisy and not very clean...no chance to get a good night rest. However the service is good and if someone likes nightlife and does not mind to stay in a bed and breakfast kinda place then I assume it is ok...however the rates are not that cheap. We go Pattaya often for the weekend and stay at many hotels but this one is not a real hotel but more a few shophouses with a noisy night club and we cannot return.

This hotel is very clean, has a great staff and a perfect location just 5 min walk to the beach.  Also the nightly cabaret show (with every night a different show!) is great to see!

      "50 I love the Venue in Pattaya-Jomtien 1.Perfect rooms - like suites; no breakfast.  2.Excellent show-cabaret with reasonable prices, no entry.  If the show runs....you hear nothing in your room.  3. Free wifi  4. Nice stuff  5. If you will invite a guest - no problem. guests must give the ID to the receptionist and will get it back, when they leave the hotel. Before the receptionst asks you, if all is fine.....very safe.  6. If you are coming very often there, they give you special prices, no need to ask - they offer that when you want to make reservation!!!!!!  If I am in Pattaya I only stay there since a couple of years.  And all my friends like it also meanwhile when they come to Jomtien. Dietmar J wrote a review Oct 2012\n",

      "50 Clean, friendly. comfortable and a good location Sorry guys, did not realise this fab Hotel was listed on here. We have stayed here twice once in the summer of 2011 and again with friends at Christmas 2011. The owners are friendly and always willing to have a chat. The staff (especially the absolutely adorable house keeper) were all attentive and friendly and nothing seemed too much trouble for them.  One of our friends is disabled so the lift was essential. As with any mechanical device, one night, returning after a few drinks, he found the lift not working! Now the spiral staircase is fine if you are able bodied, but when you are not good on your feet and need a walking stick, it can seem very frightening. Unless, that is, you have staff jumping up to help you, one helping by leading the way and another quite comically supporting you bum! Needless to say, fear gave way to serious hilarity and he got to bed fine. Can you imagine that in most UK hotels?  Rooms cleaned and service daily, tea and coffee facilities in the room and topped up generously daily. Good quality decor, good quality shower gel and shampoo supplied as well.  As some have mentioned, the noise from the show can be heard, there is no point denying it, but as the show is usually over before midnight, it rarely posed a problem. If you are staying over two weeks, see if they will give you a discount as well. We got one which made the room an even better deal and was at least 25% cheaper than the advertised rate.  We would have gone back this summer but we got such a good package deal (see my Amari Orchid review) that we could not turn it down.  I feel given the location (not the hotel itself) that it might not suit families, but you could always have a look if you are actually there.  The show is very good, however I have been going to Thailand for over ten years and they have lost some of their appeal for me personally, but even I tend to pop in a couple of times. Oh, don;t miss happy hour from the beach , two for one on most drinks and they make a great gin and tonic. Runs 4 till 7 I think (better check the board outside) SwattyHuddersfield wrote a review Oct 2012\n"

      "50 super place to stay a few nights in Jomtien for a very reasonable price The Venue, is one of the finest small hotels in Jomtien, locted in the Jomtien complex with 2 -3 minutes walk to the beach. This is a very well organized place. The front office staff is extremely friendly, very courteous, very helpful and most of them speak English. The Hotel has a nice small swimming pool, and down stairs has a very nice cabaret show in the evening which starts at 1000 pm. with some stunning performances by lady boys.No one hassels you when you are at the bar. the drinks are very reasonably priced compared with most of the other bars in the vicinity.  The rooms are excellent. Clenliness is near perfection! very comfortable bed, clean and a romantic bathroom although they are a bit small. but the rooms are comfortable enough for 02 persons.all other amenities such as TV, mini bar, 04 bottles of mineral water per day!, very clean towels, free wifi are all provided. You get the feeling that you are at home, staying at this lovely hotel. I would recomend this place above most of the small hotels in Jomtien area. I regret that it took 42 visits to Jomtien to find this place!! Mano S wrote a review Aug 2012\n",
      "50 What a night We went to the venue three times while staying in Jomtein Beach, each time we were totally amazed at the lady boy show. The amount of work that goes into the show with the dancing,songs and costumes is truly spectacular. These boys must work hard on their performances. The show is split into three with about ten minute breaks between them  The shows usually start around 10pm and usually finishes before midnight.  Try to get here early for good seating Drinks are served at the table by some really cute waiters  and a fairly priced there is no cover charge for the show  We will definately be going back the next time we are in Pattaya petercotter wrote a review Aug 2012\n",

The location is great right in the heart of Jomtien Complex and only 5 minute walk to the beach or a 5 minute baht bus ride from Boystown. I once stayed somewhere else, never again always The Venue for me. Room air con is great within 5-10 mins of turning it on the large room is cool. The shows are great being full of energy, wonderful routines and costumes. The best in the area. tpjuk wrote a review Apr 2012\n",
      "40 very nice hotel i stayed here for 2 weeks in May for my birthday.... i have normally stayed further in town so was looking for something closer to the beach. I got a great deal on a junior suite, on the top floor, so didnt hear any noise from the cabaret bar below. It was extremely good value for money (i think i was paying 999 baht a night + 7% tax) and the drinks are reasonably priced, and generously poured! It is a 5 min walk from the beach, and the staff are extremely polite and helpful, especially considering i was staying on my own. Only downside is that they dont do breakfasts, which meant a wander out in the morning to one of the cafes nearby.... JoeDav wrote a review Mar 2012\n",

      "50 Simply Superb Have stayed here a couple of times and cannot fault it, the rooms are excellent and the staff are great the owners are extremely friendly, helpful and always on hand if required. The show is excellent for all the family and don't worry there is no noise filtering through to the rooms the place is so well glazed and double glazed with doors on the corridors I was very surprised to read a previous review concerning noise, (glass to the floor job)    Mr Pokey (reception) is a delight as are the cleaning ladies and the waiting staff are genuinely pleased to be of service, in a proper way with no hassle or ulterior motive. Staying here may not be the cheapest room in Jomtien but you pay your money and you get the goods, for us it was a bargain all things considered, superbly run, attentive staff, excellent rooms, safe and a great location .... Mr Ray and Mr Darrell are delightful. I have been travelling to Thailand for 17 years and this place is a complete gem. The staff, the owners, the show the location made this one of our most enjoyable holidays to Thailand ever... can wait to go back ... Thanks plandflyer wrote a review Jan 2012\n",
      "40 Good for the price Stayed here recently and got a good rate from them directly, 999 Baht and upgraded to junior suite (normally 1500 baht). Very large room that has been recently done, very modern, tiled throughout, new furnishings. Bathoom is on the small side but does have an oversized shower. Rooms have a security safe, very well stocked mini bar with quite reasonable prices. Property is very clean and better value than others in the area for the same price. They offer free wifi but was unable to connect the entire time I was there. They aso have a swimming pool and provide beach towels in the room.    They have a very good caberet show on the ground floor every night which I really did not find disturbing from my room. They have a thick glass door at the entrance to the rooms which buffers a lot of the noise and it was actually fairly quiet.    Lovely friendly staff who go out of their way to make you comfortable. Laundry was done for a very reasonable price. Was only a 5 minute walk to beach, plenty of bars and restaurants at your doorstep. Compared to others in the complex this is one of the better choices.

      "20 Poor Service When asked if it would be possible to leave my air conditioning on for a couple of hours while I left the room, I was flatly told no. No negotiation, no compromise. The unit takes around 3 hours to fully cool the room, and being the hottest part of the year, this was a real inconvenience. All of the other hotels I have stayed at in Thailand, at lower or same prices have had no problem with this simple request. I can understand wanting to save money, but this was very hard to take. Also, the show does run till around 11:45, so if you are jet lagged and need to sleep, forget it. I was very dissapointed in this property and was clearly the worst of any I have stayed at in all of Thailand. rgehring wrote a review Apr 2011\n"

      "50 A very pleasant and moreover peaceful stay. I have just finished a month's stay at BeachNetInn, Jomtien. It's in a quiet and safe area with  fantastic rooms which in fact are ' under-priced '. A small kitchen complete with  an electric kettle, plates, bowls, cups and saucers, spoons and forks makes waking up a treat should you not feel like going out for coffee. Good a/c, TV with cable, wifi in the rooms, hot water for showers, refrigerator, king sized bed and in general just a cozy experience. 7/11 is 20 metres away and there's a GREAT restaurant right opposite across the road with a money exchanger next door giving better rates than the banks. Beauticians next door too and a motorcycle service to anywhere just 20 meters away.  A walk to the beach takes 10 to 15 minutes depending on your pace.  'The complete package ' with an extremely helpful owner who speaks good English.  I've looked at other places in Jomtien for the same/similar price..... no contest!

      "40 Beach Net Inn Jomtien This property is very nice, clean and relatively new. The staff are friendly and helpful. I stayed there for the month of January 2012. The room was large and included all of the necessary amenities, safe, a/c, hot water etc. The only bad things are that it is not 400 meters from the beach as advertised but more like 1000 metres. The other thing is that the rooms are all non smoking and that is not indicated anywhere on thier web page. It can also be difficult to get a baht bus or motorcycle taxi in the evenings. All in all it is a good inexpensive place to stay at 10,000 baht per month or just over 300 dollars. I would stay again. SooSteelers wrote a review Feb 2012\n",
      "50 Excellent budget apartment close to Jomtien Beach (Pattaya) Friends in Pattaya referred us to the Beach Net Inn in the South Pattaya area known as Jomtien Beach. It is a new construction of 9 self-service apartments, so everything is new and in perfect condition. We stayed in one of the king rooms for 2 weeks. Under $30 per night. Very comfy. Nice kingsize bed, cable TV, and air-con (a year-round necessity in Thailand). Wifi was included as was an electronic safe - both are deal breakers for me. I can't imagine staying in any resort town without a safe for passport, money, camera, etc. The apartment was only 5 minutes walk to the beach, restaurants, and convenience stores. That part of Pattaya is a better, quieter area with a nicer beach than the crowded main part of the town with all the sex bars and rowdy crowds. Still, by motorbike, all that is about 10 minutes away. The owners were very friendly and helpful and speak enough English so we didn't feel totally lost. They even arranged our transportation to Bangkok airport when we finally left. I would be happy to stay there again. PortsOfCall99 wrote a review Oct 2010\n"

      "20 Great Potential Stayed here with a large family group and predominantly booked the hotel for its location to the beech and its 4* rating. Staff were a bit hit and miss some were exceptional and others seemed totally demotivated. I did note that staff were working extremely long hours in some instances (over 12hrs). Seems to be a high churn in staff here hence the hit and miss aspect.    I was disappointed that a 4* hotel did not have a working onsite restaurant / bar or offer room service? the breakfast buffet though adequate and served it purpose was not much to talk about. Food was often cold and this could have easily been resolved with hot plates etc.    Rooms were quiet large but have seen better days, a little bit of maintenance would have gone a long way. I noted the bathroom floor kept flooding when I took a shower and soon noted the issue was just a design flaw in shower curtain rails which could easily be rectified. I am not a extremely tall person ( 5ft 10\" ) but I had to bend under the shower to use it effectively.    Wifi was very hit and miss with multiple points and user points, it would be much simpler to have one point for the whole complex.    After talking with staff members you got the feeling issues were being relayed up the chain to management but not being resolved.    With a little bit of investment in their staff and premises this place has fantastic potential but I don't currently see this forthcoming so I could not really recommend this place right now but I hope it does improve, This is definitely not a 4* premises in its current state and at best could be classed as 3*.

      "40 A good quiet hotel across the road from the beach A good quiet hotel across the road from the beach. On arrival the check in process was seamless and friendly and prompt. The room allocated was very good with all the essentials and a good view of the beach. The room was clean and well presented.  There were a couple of downsides. The wi-fi, for whatever reason, proved to be most unreliable and the breakfast provided requires comment. This was because breakfast was very basic and limited, and offered exactly the same fare each morning. Western fare was somewhat limited as the restaurant catered more so for the Chinese tourist who made up the majority of hotel guests.  Hotel staff were friendly and helpful.  The hotel is away from the hustle and bustle of the tourist traps and there were some reasonable restaurants, bars and super-marts within easy walking distance.  Certainly not a four star hotel and the price could be cheaper when compared to similar hotels in the area. But worth a stay. Greg M wrote a review Apr 2017\n",
      "40 Good location , helpful staff I went to Jomtien Beach on 3rd of April. I got some hotels on my mind but I didn't decide it yet. I drove to check this out.    After I arrived, a porter escorted me to the reception and showed me two rooms. (I asked to see a room with pool access.) One room was on the second building and another was at the main building.    I have found that the room at the main building was more spacious, clean and comfortable, with microwave and utensils. So I took it.    Some tips..  - Almost of the staffs were quite friendly.  - An ATM was just in front of the hotel.  - Pool was open 24 hours. (only at the main building)  - Minibar prices very reasonable.  - No room service (not far from the hotel there was 7-11 and you can call a staff to buy something)  - Spa was under reconstruction.  - Parking spaces were a bit narrow.  - No stair from balcony to pool area.

      "10 Oh Blimey. We booked this hotel for 1 night and may possibly stay for 8 nights.  We didn't last the first day.  We were offered a couple of rooms.  1 on the 9th floor, but the balcony had a tall concrete wall around and 2 most basic wooden chairs for 4000 baht.  2nd room room 220 direct access to the pool.  All was quiet when we looked and the patio doors were open and it smelt ok.  Then some Chinese arrived by coach. My god. Shouting and staring in the room. So we had to close the doors. It then smelt of stale tobacco, YUK!! If you smoke fine. If you don't like me it was terrible.  This hotel is not 4star. 1 star maybe.  I can honestly say it's the worst place EVER.  I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER WHEN I SAW THE 2 porters wearing shabby trainers.  Plus they damaged my new case !!!!  Stay here at your peril !! Dennis L wrote a review Jan 2017\n",
      "10 Horrible! Don't waste your money! Shower curtain had mold on it, room was hot, they only allow for one key per room, the \"sea view room\" was actually sea side, the management was virtually unreachable and unresponsive and realistically didn't care! When I tried to resolve the issue about the falsely room I got no help and no resolution so I checked out went to another hotel! The worst experience I have ever had! Wouldn't recommend it.

Staff was so friendly. Breakfast buffet was variety from bread, eggs, salad, ham and sausages to rice and noodle plus fruit and Thai Desert.    There were many famous seafood restaurants nearby.

      "20 some things you just do once... Good:  Staff (friendly, as normal in Thailand). Location: across the road from a beach and outside of, but close to Pattaya if you want it, and not far from Baan Saray too.  Pool is clean.    Bad:  Bed: ROCK hard! My wife didn't sleep during our stay here, and I woke with a sore back each day. They brought a softer top mattress, but this did little to help.  Location: There are two (or perhaps three) similalry named hotels in Jomtien beach. After an hour of searching for ours, we cxxd our previous booking, and made a reservation here at the reception.  Internet: infuriating at times, okay at others. Constantly disconnects (as quickly as a minute at times). Constantly need to get new internet sign-in cards.  Pool: set in between rooms and buildings.  Breakfast: not much selection.  Light on balcony cannot be controlled by guest, and is on until 0100hours. Dave_Jen_Finne wrote a review Mar 2016\n",
      "10 Absolutely rubbish One of my worst experience in Pattaya hotels. Old and silly hotel with a narrow minded management. Needless to say the poor breakfast, they like giving hurdles to guests for using WiFi. Password and settings change everyday. Hair dryer amazing, smaller and weaker than a toy. Full of mosquitos everywhere.  Believe me, remove it from your list of consideration. Sunny Happy wrote a review Mar 2016\n",
      "10 Disappointed and Misleading We booked this hotel via Agoda website, and by the look of the pictures, we thought we would be staying in a modern, clean and isolated hotel....and how wrong were we!  1- the Reception was supposed to be big and welcoming, clean and bright: it was hot (no air con) and filthy. The lady at the desk was rude and they were all over the place when they had to give us our breakfast vouchers. Very stressful arrival.  2- The front of terrace of the hotel was supposed to big enough to have tables and chairs and a buffet for breakfast, which has continental and healthy options. The reality: the front terrace was bare, with only few dirty and dusty chairs. the buffet? Inexistent!  3- The area: as mentioned earlier on, it looked like there was no car around and no buildings. Quite a peaceful area to stay in...well, wrong again, very busy street. hotel surrounded by either little shops or building sites. Close to the sea? Definitively. very dirty beach, full of litter! I just don't get why people spoil Thailand beaches. it could be so lovely, and everyone could enjoy it. such a shame for this beautiful landscape.  4- The restaurant: well, they only serve breakfast. Just be aware of it. and the continental option doesn't exist either. Fruits looked tired and bruised.  5 - The staff: very unhelpful and rude. We had the audacity of asking if there was any beds to put on the wooden chaises longue by the pool. We got told really rudely that there weren't any and the new ones would come later. We did have the impression that we were bothering her and she had better things to do.  6- The room: on pictures, very spacious and clean. Well, this time, yes! it is true. We had two connected rooms, with spacious bathrooms and a nice living room. At least, we had something to hold on to.  7- Value for money? Maybe when it was first built. But not when we stayed. We paid a fair amount to only stay in the room for 2 nights, because the facilities were dreadful. We had to go to another hotel to spend the day!  Overall, this hotel looks really run down and staff doesn't believe in that hotel either.  Agoda seems to still showing pictures of that hotel when it was first opened and it was probably a nice place to stay. They don't seem to have updated any of the pictures.  This is not the first time, this issue has happened to us: booking with agoda and reality is totally different! Catherine F wrote a review Feb 2016\n"

      "20 Do NOT waste money here! In a country where you get the best value-for-money for hotels, this hotel is a real waste of your money! First bad impression: 20 minutes check-in process by a receptionist who didn't speak any English and was not well-trained for her job.    Regarding the room let's start with rule number 1 of housekeeping: make sure there's toilet paper in the bathroom (there was none! And no tissues of any sort in the room for that matter). The bathtub/shower is terribly designed and no matter how careful you are the floor will be flooded with water from shower. Swimming pool was not well maintained. Didn't get to try the breakfast as they stop at 10 am (perhaps a bit early for weekends in a holiday resort).    This was a weekend stay, and on Sunday morning at 8 am we were woken up by hotel staff who were doing some repairs in the garden, with no consideration whatsoever for comfort of hotel guests on a weekend.    All in all, you can find much better options in the same price range. Globagard wrote a review Dec 2015\n",
      "40 Spacious room. Booked the deluxe, side sea view room.  Room: Surprisingly quite spacious, with microwave oven. They also provide a beach bag with towels.The pillow is very comfortable and the air con work great.  Breakfast: Simple fare, not really tasty.  Location: It is located just next to the beach. There is a car park below the hotel.  Overall quite value for money. ChaoPeng wrote a review Dec 2015\n",
      "30 The good and bad I will start with the bad. 9th floor rooms are below the roof area and there is a constant noise all night from air con or some other pumps. This is bad but that stops around 5.00 am, you can then hear the water pumps kicking in every time someone throughout the hotel uses a tap or the loo etc. Air con in the room is hideously noisy but it drowns all other noise so I suppose it serves it's purpose. I had enough by 5.15am and went down to reception to get ANO room. Staff were unsurprised and very accommodating so I guess they get this complaint regularly. DO NOT be booked into 9th floor.  The next room was OK, good shower, TV, room size and good bed. Bad smell every now and then in bathroom, no tea and coffee, no balcony furniture so it was unusable even though it was nice with a good view, air con OK but not terribly effective. Ground floor pool was poor with hardly any water and a lot of leaves etc but no matter there is a great pool on the second floor. Wifi was fine but had to log in every 3 hours and get new password daily. Brilliant staff all cheery and helpful, they are the hotels' salvation. There are some really nice public areas and the hotel is generally pleasant, well kept and clean. Breakfast I found to be fine but you have to adapt to Thai cuisine and not be stuck in \"bacon and egg\" mode. The dining room is very nice and absolutely spotless, breakfast staff are very attentive to replenishing and keeping the place clean.  The local area is fine if a little off the central area of Jomtien. Plenty of restaurants 7 11's etc.  I would have been very unhappy had I paid room rate but with 60% off, on balance and ignoring the first night, I think it was fair value. gordonj258 wrote a review Dec 2015\n",
      "20 Tea and coffee making facilities without the tea/coffee! We had to stop in this area, because our friend's apartment was 10 minutes walk away. I could tell from my research that there was nothing marvellous around here, but this seemed the best of a bad bunch! The staff weren't genuinely helpful - they seemed like they were just doing their job. We were given cards each day with a new internet password. In reality they only lasted 3 hours, so we kept having to go down to reception to get new ones throughout the day and first thing in the morning. On top of that, the receptionists insisted that they lasted 24 hours. We complained about this several times, but they didn't believe us. Infact, they had'nt a clue! Our booking said we had tea and coffee making facilities. This consisted of a kettle and 2 cups! We complained, but they said our superior room didn't qualify for coffee and tea sachets. How mean! So what was the kettle for? In addition, we had a mini bar and no glasses. The breakfast was appalling! Ten different stir frys and watery curries containing only stewed vegetables, which I'm sure was reheated the next day. However, there was toast, which you could cover in plastic looking substances in a variety of colours. I would have given the hotel only one star, but the room was clean! So in conclusion, I don't recommend this place. Jeannie-Liz wrote a review Dec 2015\n",
      "30 Decent hotel away from the hustle and bustle Stayed in one of the villas, decent size room but had seen better days. Dark wooden interior with nails sticking out of the floor boards and a bathroom design that leaked every time I had a shower was not great.    However, staff were friendly and quick to answer any questions and were very helpful to fix the safe in the room. Not all staff speak English but they quickly contacted colleagues who could.    A stone's throw from the beach but to be honest, it's not particularly nice so just stayed at the hotel pool.    Breakfast buffet is pretty bad - recommend you turn right and walk about 20m to Cafe Le Mar if you want a decent meal (not sure if open for breakfast though).    This is on the other side of Jomtien road and much quieter - if you do want to go into town, jump on a 'jeepney' (a massive tuk tuk) and just pay 10baht when you get off. Don't bother engaging with the driver as he will know you don't know the price and will rip you off (tried to charge us 400 baht for 4 people...). A local farang told us it's 10baht regardless of where you get on/off. Don't ask the hotel staff to help you wave one of these down as they will quote the same ridiculous price and make a cut with the drivers. Mokkey8 wrote a review Dec 2015\n",
      "20 Not recommended! I did a lot of hotel reviews, mostly positive, or at least fair. This hotel was very disappointing to me. My check in was horrible. Took ages, staff didn't really understood english, didn't allow me to pay deposit in euro etcetc. I would say the staff was rude! Don't expect that towards a customer.    In all fairness, the room is good. All amenities are there. But there was no hot water and the safe didn't work. The 2 pools are okay, but combined they have 10 sunbeds. Not much for a big hotel. During my stay it didnt matter since i was the only one. Which might have a reason ;).The breakfast is of very low standard. You'd better sleep a bit longer.    Lastly, and this is always important to me, the location is bad. No decent beach, no shops, hardly restaurants. Of course for 20tbh there is taxis available. But i like to have this within walking distance. If you wanna stay in jomtien I would recommend Jomtien centre. That has at least beach, restaurants, bars, shops.    So all in all it was very disappointing. Price quality wise its a joke, rude staff, bad location, no hot water, bad breakfast.... Im sorry for the place but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. twofinger wrote a review Nov 2015\n",
      "30 An okay place for the price,with a good location but not much else to cheer on We primarily chose to stay at this hotel based on its location on Jomtien, so that I could easily drive to another hotel where I had to attend a seminar.    The hotel is limited on space, so the first thing we found is that the entrance and the exit of the hotel's parking lot share the same ramp, which means that guests have to make way for each other. (Stop to look a little before you drive down the ramp.)    The room is spacious. We chose to stay on the top floor, but the sea view is very much blocked by the balcony's concrete wall. This means that to get a glimpse of the sea from up there, we had to stand on the balcony. (I suppose, in terms of views, you might be better off staying on a lower floor, of which the balcony's wall is not made of concrete.)    More on the sea view, since there is no tall building immediately adjacent to the hotel, it is easy to sea the beach from the room or the breakfast area. (Well.. if it is not blocked by the concrete wall anyway.)    The biggest problem of the room is the bathroom. It was clean but not squeaky clean like in some better-ranked hotels, and it could feel somewhat stuffy. The water didn't drain very well. So, if we turned on the shower at maximum, we would most likely flood the bathroom and the bedroom. To stay on the safe side, keep the shower at mid range.    The pool area is quite nice, especially if you stay in a room of which the balcony is directly connected to the pool. (Recommend you stay in one of these rooms, though it may be more expensive.)    The staff was nice and helpful. However, I think the hotel would do better with the staff's uniform. The uniform looks cheap, and some of the staff where flip-flops (often with socks), which I think is the worst combination.    The breakfast was average. There are some Chinese condiments we don't often find at other hotels, which is a plus.    Overall, it is an okay hotel with a good location. Not sure I would stay there again, though. p-onnicha wrote a review Sep 2015\n"

      "50 A very good choice Having found our pre booked accommodation to be well below standard we looked for an alternative and were so lucky to choose this hotel.  Obviously improvements around the hotel are still being made but nothing that would detract from the wonderful friendly staff, the excellent standard of the rooms, pools and food and the location just across from the beach.  We would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for quality, location and value who like to be looked after by attentive, friendly, nothing is too much trouble staff. fryerwood wrote a review Mar 2015\n",
      "10 Never Again! Never before I wrote a comment about any hotel, but now i must warn everybody: this is the worsest hotel i had ever been in my whole life and there were a lot!  I have been there for 7 nights, booked in the junior suite. But the furnitures there were haggled. So I moved to the another room. But at the pool villa there were the hotbed of mosquitos, then I checked the other rooms … at the end I must pay additional amount to stay at (acceptable) executive suite.  Definitely 0 star for the absolutely incompetent management and the owners. 1 star for the friendly but poor staff only. The staff could only smile because of this very bad managed hotel (boring breakfast, bad room conditions/pool conditions/fitness room conditions ... unjustified high room prices, too expensive inspite of 40% late booking discount).

      "30 Great location And specious rooms and friendly staff. But .... be aware that currently there is construction going on right behind the main building. That means using the small swimming pool is useless. Buffet breakfast was basic and very, very slow serving the set-menu & tea / coffee. Buying nice new towels for in the rooms would also be a great thing to do.    It is only for the location (right at the beach road) and the friendly staff that I give a average.

      "30 ROYAL THAI PAVILION HOTEL, JOMTIEN BEACH, PATTAYA This is not a four star hotel! Many web sites have this hotel rated so high! A good place to bring Thai families that want to be near the beach and near Thai food places. The beach area across the street from the hotel is not the best beach area. Down the street is much better! Nice French restaurant one soi down from the hotel. Staff service is not that great! Checking in and out is like dealing with people who never did there jobs before. Hotel requires 2000 baht deposit on each room, cash only and 500 baht deposit for additional room key cards. Hotel has a very limited restaurant, not even 2 star. If you want to be toward the end of Jomtien Beach, then this is an ok place. The rooms are ok, nothing special and the views of the beach is across the street not on the beach as advertised. Nice quite area, not much happening, around here. Not a resort. No Spa and nothing extra with the hotel. They are building 30 new rooms behind the current hotel but you will have to decide for yourself if it is worth staying at. Many better choices in Pattaya for the price, which I believe if overpriced! Explore and enjoy! GEORGE J A wrote a review Nov 2014\n",
      "30 Good hotel quiet location Hotel is located right on the Jomtien beach road in a quiet location on away from the busy Pattaya.  WiFi was free and a small buffet breakfast was included in the price which was offered at 50% discount.  Small underground parking.  Good view of the beach from floor 5.  Good value with the 50% discount.  Friendly staff dumfries12 wrote a review Oct 2014\n",

      "20 Seriously bad value and dirty pool. DONT GO THERE. This hotel would be good value if it was £25 per night/$20. The swimming pool looks amazing, but when you get into it, you can see lots of missing tiles in the swimming pool and that while area is covered in disgusting, dirty green moss!! The hotel is based in a lovely tranquil, relaxing environment and area but it is miles away from anything else, it's far far away and at night the baht buses don't go that far so you have to walk a lot in the dark at night in a derelict part of the town, the breakfast isn't very good, it's a standard set breakfast meal everyday, eggs weren't cooked properly and I couldn't believe that they served me a mouldy croissant and a mouldy pasty/pie on different occasions. What with the moss in the pool and the mould in my food....I was really turned off this place and for £45 a night it just doesn't cut it! I moved out a day early, of my 3 day stay they refused to give me a refund!! Like I said if it was £25 I would expect a dirty pool and maybe bad food but not from £45/50 per night!!! This should be too luxury for that price!! Oh yes and the only way to use the shower in the bathroom means that all the water runs all the way around the bath and drowns the floor in water which make it dangerous and unpleasant!

      "10 Do Not Stay Here Under Any Circumstances Royal Thai Pavilion Hotel    If visiting Thailand under no circumstances make any bookings for this hotel, as they are criminals.    We made a booking the night before on the 22-11-13 for two rooms 3-nights one room was to have separate beds only noted in the special instructions through http://www.sawadee.com/ and on arrival at this hotel they could not and would not provide us with the room types that we clearly made in our booking nor after asking the staff many many times would the manager speak directly with us so we left and found alternate accommodation.    Still as of today I am fighting with them & Sawadee.com for a full refund. Our CreditCard Company has also been advised fully of what occurred.    From now on we will find accommodation on arrival in our location as no further bookings will made in advance.    Please be aware. D4VE88 wrote a review Dec 2013\n",
      "30 Good stay if you get a good price! Ok hotel, rooms are clean and large. Booked through Agoda.com and received a good rate for the two pool vilas. No problem at check in despite turning up a few hours after doing the online booking.    Staff were reserved but friendly. Reception seems to struggle with English but they managed without issues. Had to deposit THB 1000/- per room ( we booked two rooms) for the mini bar, which was refunded when checking out with no issues.    There was some construction going on at the back which was a bit noisy but did not disturb us much as they don't work in the nights or early morning. Pool was nice and large ( only issue being some Indian guests getting into the pool with all their clothes despite messages posted to wear swim wear !! Don't blame the hotel for this but maybe they can enforce the rules a bit more strictly to ensure hygiene )    The staff specially the bell boys were very helpful making sure all are needs were taken care if and providing us information when requested re places of interest and how to get to places.    Remember this is away from main Pattaya stretch. So if you are looking for a hotel in the area close to walking street then this is not for you. jomtien is a slow region of Pattaya and more where Thais holiday we saw. But if you want to enjoy a peaceful clean holiday this is a good area. Lot of food options specially for seafood.    Overall good place to stay. Price you pay for the room can be a decision factor.

      "10 Terrible. Too many better options elsewhere Do not stay here. There are SO many better options.  We were a group who had booked 5 deluxe rooms.  On arrival, there was a slight issue where the extra-bed for the child hadn't been arranged. They refused to allow us to check-in unless we paid an additional 1000 baht per night for the extra room (even though we had paid 84,000 baht for the weeks stay!) We had said in the booking that it was for 2 adults and 1 child and the hotel had forgotten to add the 1000 baht per night.  Don't get me wrong, the receptionist staff were amazing at trying to sort this out, but were told by the hotel owner (Thai owned female owner) who said to their staff, \"IF YOU CHECK THEM IN WITHOUT PAYMENT, I WILL CHECK THE CCTV AND IF YOU DON'T GET THE MONEY, I WILL SACK YOU\".  The staff were shaking with fear about being threatened.  We paid the additional money and we checked in.  We were on holiday, so didn't want this initial issue to spoil it, so were ready to have a nice time. However....    The actual hotel room is fine, albeit, the air con is super noisy, however, this came in handy because of the ridiculously noisy live band that plays in the bar next door to the hotel until 1am every night. Moreover, the noise from the Royal Thai Pavilion 2 hotel that is under construction starts at 7am Mon-Sat, but the noisy air-con couldn't drown that out.    The breakfasts are not good. Don't ask for an extra cup of coffee/ top up, else the staff say that the owner makes you pay for the coffee after you finish your first cup. Again, they said she checks CCTV to make sure they are not charging. There is a breakfast buffet style at weekends where you can have as much food / coffee as you like. I can't see what the difference is for guests Mon- Fri (Thai logic??)    Gym - dangerous and is an insult to use the word 'gym'. Old equipment that either doesn't work, or the cables are worn and about to snap.    Swimming pool - dirty and rarely cleaned. There are also around 60 tiles missing on the inside where slimy bacteria and algae is growing. Sharp edges on the broken tiles makes this pool rather disgusting and unsightly. I spoke to the staff who said they have asked the owner to fix, but she refuses to do so.    'Deluxe Beach View' rooms - This hotel has two gap sites either side of it, both of which are terrible to look at and with construction of another hotel behind. Whilst you can see the beach from your room, 90% of your eye is drawn to the terrible view next to the hotels.    Positives - Actual room is fine, but over priced for what it is. However, due to all the remaining negatives, this hotel, should never be on your radar. 7/11 and laundry nearby also. Hotel is right next to the beach.    Negatives - Owner does not know how to run a service-industry hotel building. So many things wrong that it wasn't a great experience. She actually turned up at the hotel once and sat having a coffee. I watched her and actually felt sorry for her as she looked a very unhappy person who spoke badly to the staff.  Construction starts at 7am till 5pm, and then the live band at the bar next door starts 8pm till 1am. It is not a relaxing hotel to be at. KwaiLaw wrote a review Aug 2013\n"

      "30 Ok but not special Probably not a bad choice for Jomtien - some of the places along the beach look pretty shabby. This place has nice enough rooms, if a bit rough around the edges - I had one that opens onto the pool. But there is a lack of service (unless you speak Thai), no room service, and only very basic breakfast. The tv reception was poor, but the free wifi worked well. For the cost it was ok.    There is a narrow stretch of beach over the road and some fishing boats to provide a little local colour.    There is not much going on in Jomtien, and the half-built developments and empty plots (one beside the hotel) do not add to the ambiance... JerryPlus3 wrote a review Apr 2013\n",

After being shown the 'only room available' we decided for one night it was better than nothing. Only after we agreed to take the room were we informed we had to pay a deposit, which I found bizarre. I've stayed in hundreds of hotels and have never been asked this before.  The reception staff spoke almost no English and were very rude, giving us no help whatsoever. The room seemed pretty expensive for what it was.  The location is also pretty bad; it's at the far end of Jomtien beach and is very quiet (some might call it rather dead).  Don't stay here, stay somewhere else further up the beach. bexybr wrote a review Feb 2013\n",

      "10 Worst Hotel and Rudest Staff - Sure to close down soon if this unwelcoming attitude continues We had booked a Sea facing double room for 2 nights. When we checked in, the reception staff was very rude and informed us that the rooms are not available. When we showed them the confirmed booking made online, we were asked to contact www.Hotels.com from where we had booked online. After heated arguments for almost 1 hour, the rude counter staff offered a pool Facing Villa which is very small. The toilets were badly stinking and when we reported this the room boy came 2-3 times and sprayed some room freshner. However the problem still continued.    The staff do not understand any language other than Thai and they are the rudest staff I have ever seen in my whole life. My sincere advise to all travellers to Pattaya is to avoid this hotel at any cost. You will get the worst treatment of your life and it will surely spoil your vacations. The hotel is also too far away. They are very very rigid and not at all flexible on any count. There are several better hotels on the same Jomtien Beach road at the same or even cheaper rates. Even the complimentary breakfast offered is below average.    We have vowed never to stay in this hotel again. I wont be surprised to see this hotel close down on my next visit to Pattaya. sanra0 wrote a review Nov 2012\n",
      "40 Nice but too far away We booked this hotel knowing is was located a bit from the centre of Jomtien, still it was a bit too far off in our experience. The taxi-buses that run along beach road often stopped before reaching the hotel, forcing us to walk a bit. And it was necessary to leave since there's no restaurant (except for a fine breakfast).  However, the hotel itself was good. Our spacious villa was right by the pool. The place was quiet and service friendly. Magnus wrote a review Nov 2012\n",
      "40 Great Private Retreat This has to be my 6th time staying at Royal Thai Pavilion and for good reasons too. Number 1 has to be the great privacy. You would not run into noisy packed group tourists here. As there are not many guests here espeically during low seasons, you will treated like a royal guest. Also, this location at a quieter part of Jomtien beach is perfect for couple wanting to get away from the sneaziness of cetral Pattaya. The beach is across the road. Service is always excellent and non-intrusive. Room cleanliness is of high standard and breakfast is good. Cliches as it sounds, this place is a home away from home for me and my unreserved first choice whenever I visit Pattaya. hands22 wrote a review Jul 2012\n",
      "10 AVOID AT ALL COST!! The expieriance went from bad to worse as I checked in. The staff are the rudest hotel staff I have ever come accross in my years of traveling!!! Rude is under statement, lake of communication, direction and overall understanding about basic requests/needs. On check in I requested a beer with my son. We received I semi cold Stale beer, that was foul! When we took one sip we knew that something wasn't right! So we tried to nicely say that we didn't want the beer. The staff tried to insist on us paying after in depth heated discussion we agreed. The Beds are Hard as a rock! I believe that I may have been attacked by bed bugs as I now have welts all over my body from that bed. When entering the bathroom at first impression it looks quite good. When I went to have a shower (twice daily) the water doesn't drain because they have placed the drain at the wrong end of the shower. When I asked them about the problem they shrugged there shoulders. They would have to know about this problem but choose not too!(I even had the room maids come up and showed them, they didn't even get it fixed or try to as it can't be fixed unless a full bathroom Reno is conducted, nothing was offered for my content mopping up there problems, not even a smile) This Hotel is laughable it is so bad!!! My room was not made up daily when I got home from daily events. 3-4pm. I had to request that my room be made up then sit on my small balcony. Every day I had to complain. If you an early riser forget breakfast because it doesn't start to 8am and mind you it is terrible!! Pre wrapped in glad wrap from the past days/weeks. On check out the staff tried to charge me for a beach towel and a kit Kat. (the beach towel was used to mop up one of the showers but was not taken at all) and the kit Kat was probably taken by the maid in spite because she actually was forced to do something. I could go on and on about the extreme lack of service at this hotel, But I just want this to Serve a serious warning! Stay here at your own PERAL!!! Trendz7 wrote a review Jan 2012\n"

      "50 Small boutique hotel great service After checking in we were upgraded to a junior suite and to be honest if I stayed here again I would definitely pay for the upgrade as the difference in the room size made a huge difference to the comfort our stay. The deluxe room although very comfortable and very well presented is very small in comparison to the junior suite. The breakfast has an excellent choice from cereal to full English and Thai food, the pool area does not get the sun until approximately 1pm so be prepared to spend the morning on the beach over the road if you are early risers!  The prices for the mini bar were much the same as some of the local bars and the service we received at the hotel was very good.  We would definitely recommend the bar/restaurant next door called Cafe le Mar, the food is excellent and the staff are very friendly and nothing is too much trouble. The beach bar belonging to the bar is also very good and the food is served to you on the beach in your deck chair!  Overall we would definately recommend this hotel and will be coming back to stay again in the future.  The local resort is very Russian orientated and many of the menus and shops have Russian as their first language, however on saying this we have loved the local area and if you are looking for something a little quieter and tamer than pattaya city then this resort will probably suit you better!  The local beach has yellow sand and although the street sellers will come and offer you all their goods they aren't a nuisance and if you say no they do leave you alone. The deck chairs are adequate, although not as comfortable as a sun lounger but this just seems to add to the the local atmosphere and anything else would seem out of place.  The local prices are very good value, but remember to haggle!!! Katie T wrote a review Dec 2011\n",

      "40 A little peace in Pattaya The biggest plus about this hotel is its privacy... no big groups of tourists disturbing the peace. As this is still a relatively new and unknown hotel right on the Jotiem beach, I hope that it stays that way.    Room is exactly as shown...big, spacious,comfortable and everything works! The balcony chairs are a little hard and uncomfortable and the view of the sea is partly blocked by the trees but it's still great to relax by the balcony. The bed is firm and comfortable and the LCD TV is nicely mounted on the wall for a pleasant viewing experience. The curtain skirting around the bath tub is not that practical....water tends to drip to the floor and otherwise, no major complaint.    Housekeeping is prompt and attentive. Staff are always smiling and respectful. The continental breadfast choice is pretty satisfactory but you do not want to eat the same thing everyday. Overall a great experience and I would recommend this highly to anyone who wants a little privacy and peace in Pattaya. hands22 wrote a review Nov 2011\n",
      "10 Disappointing verging on fraudulent. Cut our losses and cut our stay short. We booked a \"Villa Pool Access\" room for two nights. Be warned that there are two of these rooms, and the photos shown on agoda.com are of the better of the two. The other room (the one we had) does not have a microwave as shown in the pictures, and it has significantly less furnishings as compared to what is shown in the pictures.    The main reason we checked out early is that this room is the one closest to the street of all 32 rooms in the hotel, and is very noisy during the day. Furthermore if you swim there you are in full view of everyone in the lobby / reception area, as well as people sitting in the outdoor dining area. It's very uncomfortable and hardly the type of romantic privacy you expect when you pay the extra money for a \"Pool Villa\". At any other resort (e.g. Keeree Waree in Prachuap Kirikan which is only 800 baht more than Royal Thai Pavilion) a Pool Villa is separate from the rest of the accommodation, and affords a higher level of peace, quiet and privacy. At Royal Thai Pavilion it's the exact opposite - the Villa Pool Access room we had is the least quiet and least private in the entire establishment, and you pay extra to get it!    The room was sparsely furnished - the lounge chairs and coffee table shown in the photos on agoda.com were not present. The only seating was a backless lounge at the foot of the bed which was extremely uncomfortable for sitting to watch TV. The other option was to sit in the bed, however this is so far from the TV that you can't see it clearly anyway. Perhaps the proprietor expects you to stand while watching TV.    The buffet breakfast is minimalistic, far below expectations given the room rate. Marriott Hua-Hin charges approximately the same room rate low-season and their breakfast buffets is probably 5 times better. Even the meagre offerings at the Royal Thai Pavilion's 8am to 10am breakfast buffet weren't enough for the number of guests, and they started running out of food about 9:20am.    Given there was no way we were going to enjoy the rest of our stay, we decided to salvage the rest of our long weekend and checked out a day early to return home to Bangkok. On checkout the reception staff asked why we were checking out early - we answered that we didn't like it, but they showed no interest in knowing why and if there was anything they could do to help.    All in all it appears that the operator is trying to dress this barely 3 star hotel up to look (at least in the publicity photos) like a 4 or 5 star resort, which it definitely is not. In fact for approximately the same price you can get a proper pool access room at Cosy Beach in Pattaya which we've also been to.    I can't imagine which segment of the market would be satisfied with Royal Thai Pavilion. Backpackers would be happy with the rooms, but the price is too high. Those looking for a resort stay would be happy with the price, but disappointed as we were with everything else. Given this, I am extremely skeptical of the good reviews of Royal Thai Pavilion posted here.    The proprietor should cut their rates by 30% to 50% and post more accurate information on their web listings. JohnGalt01 wrote a review Jul 2011\n",
      "50 Holiday of a lifetime and stayed at an amazing hotel in Thailand We booked a family holiday in Pattaya, Thailand. This was the third time in Pattaya, and first time staying in this boutique style hotel. We booked a suite as the pictures looked really good. Saying that you never really know what to expect until you actually get there. I must say we were all pleasantly surprised by how lovely the hotel was. The room was massive compared to other hotels we’ve stayed in with all the usual TV/DVD etc. and the place was really clean.    The rest of the hotel was spotlessly clean and tastefully decorated. We stayed in the Villa Pool Access suite so the pool was right outside our room and patio. The best was the salt-water swimming pool, my daughter has eczema and chlorine irritates her skin. It’s almost impossible to find a hotel that doesn’t use chlorine.    Around the hotel was a lovely aroma of orangey fragrances, I was told it keeps the mosquitoes away. It adds to the relaxing atmosphere of the tropical gardens surrounding the hotel. We were made welcome, the service was top notch and very friendly.    If you’re into golf then you’ll be spoilt for choice with all the golf courses around, I got to play a couple of rounds at Natural Park Hill Resort Country Club which is one of the best, it was only about 45 minutes by taxi.    There’s loads of restaurants and shopping malls around and easy to get to. You can hop onto one of the frequent minibuses available if you don’t fancy walking to some of the open air and indoor markets where you can buy almost anything.    All in all a big thumbs up from all of us! Glessland wrote a review Jun 2011\n"

      "50 Amazing view.. professional, caring staff One bedroom suite with a balcony, a bath with a tub, a huge living room, and TWO Air Conditioners!!!! Good location on Soi 9, less than one block from the beach... A really good American restaurant no more than a minutes walk toward the beach on the left side of the street. I watched this place being built, and I'm delighted to have spent ten excellent days there!!!!! Grover W wrote a review Sep 2018\n",
      "50 Will visit again First thing to note is that this is an apartment and not a hotel and bless it for being so. Superb location spitting distance to the beach and minutes walk to the night market with a 7-Eleven and restaurants at the end of the Soi (street). Spotlessly clean, huge space, only semi-ocean view but it's blocked by greenery - just lovely. This was my third time visiting Pattaya and I'll be back here again - I could quite honestly live there.    Only thing of note and it wasn't said in the booking - check in is across the street in another building which caused us confusion when arriving, but it's forgivable as I can't recommend this place enough. nichenet wrote a review Mar 2018\n",
      "50 best acommodation in Pattaya here you get the best value for money. really big and comfortable apartments with new furniture.I came from a hotel where the furniture was almost missing - a 4 star Sea crest hotel. here you will find everything necessary in perfect condition. appartments are cleaned every 3 days very wellq 4-5 women make your apartment shining.  area is quite and safe very close to the beach. many restaurant and coffes around  the property has a very pleasant pool area kept clean Trek11784939580 wrote a review Mar 2018\n",
      "50 Good Sized Apartment, Well Priced Stayed here a few years ago and decided to come back again. Nice sized apartment once again, with pretty good facilities and well-managed and looked after. Location is great for Jomtien beach. The block seems to be a mix of residents and short term rentals, so is generally pretty quiet. The staff are very friendly and helpful. diveboard_man wrote a review Nov 2017\n",
      "50 Feels like home! Jometien Beach Residence offers you proper fully furnished apartments. It ain't a hotel so don't expect any kind of service at all except cleaning.    Rooms - We stayed at a beautiful 2 bedrooms apartment furnished with all kind of amenities. It had all luxury furniture, modular fully equipped kitchen, variety of books, swimming tools, toys for kids, almost anything you want. The apartment had 3 balconies offering magnificent view of the ocean.    Location - It is based at the Jometien Beach as the name suggests.    Staff - There ain't any!!    Parking - Ample parking space available.    Food - As i said there is no service available. You can cook your own food.    Pros - Go there to relax yourself. You will enjoy if you are willing to cook for yourself.    Cons - If power goes off they don't have any backup and the people at the reception don't understand English well.

      "50 Comfortable and good prices. Good local, that is nearest Jomtien Beach. In-room has a complete kitchen; microwave, plate, knife, refrigerator, hot pot etc. The room is clean and comfortable. I really recommend this place when you travel to Jomtien Beach. p_vunsen wrote a review Jul 2017\n",
      "50 Beautiful hotel, quiet, great location and facilities We loved our stay at Jomtien Beach Residence. We found our room to be immaculate- incredibly clean, very comfy beds, lovely interior. Such a relaxing room. Additionally, the hotel has a great gym/fitness room, 2 swimming pools, book exchanges and a very friendly helpful staff. The hotel is walking distance to the beach and night market and just a short taxi away from walking street, shopping malls and downtown Pattaya. Really loved our stay, exactly what we needed:) Handog6 wrote a review Jul 2017\n",
      "40 Great value for your dollar Stayed here in May for three nights with my wife and daughter. Had a one bedroom suite. Rooms were clean and spacious. Had full living room, large balcony, kitchen, bedroom and a large bathroom. Excellent value for the price. Only a double bed but staff was quick to bring us a crib for our daughter. Also has a good size swimming pool and gym. Thanks for the stay.. will be Booking again when back in the area. Iain M wrote a review May 2017\n",
      "30 Simple residence Residence is old and the rooms should be updated. Concerning the low price it was ok. Small swimmingpool but big enough as there was not any other users than we. There was no coffeemaker, it was a big minus.  Quite near the Jomtien beach. TiinaS8 wrote a review Aug 2016\n",

      "50 relaxing with good location Nice holiday condo's centrally located on Jomtien Beach.  Beach, restaurants, night market, bath buses all very close is great. I like the fact that its 50m from beach road so you don't get the noize from the street but still have easy access to transportation. I would definitely recommend to others who want to relax but still have convenient location to food, shopping and activities. BrianMDK wrote a review May 2016\n",
      "40 Great Condo This Condo was a pleasant surprise. It really felt like I had my own apartment while at Jomtien Beach. I had pretty much everything I needed and there was LOTS of space.  The good thing was that the bedroom was separate from the living room which also included a small kitchen with functioning utensils. The fridge was a great size with a working freezer. Flat screens were in both rooms and the couch was very comfortable, as was the bed. Bathroom also worked well and the room was cleaned daily.  7-11 and Family Mart a 2 minute walk away.    This complex also houses tenants who live here permanently. It is a short walk to the beach.    The only negative thing was that the WIFI connection was pretty much non-existent while I was there...I bought a Thai SIM card from DTAC which solved the problem and was a great asset to have in Thailand in general.    There was some noise from a pack of dogs in the area during the night, and there is plenty of bird noise very early in the morning so you will need to deal with this. Scrambler2 wrote a review Dec 2015\n",
      "30 A bit tired We have stayed here several times. Location excellent next to the beach, baht bus to Central. Apartment large and very clean. Staff helpful and efficient.    We were disappointed with our apartment this time, it could do with a lick of paint, the settee was uncomfortable and there were hardly any cooking pans. The hand held shower only provided a trickle of cold water, the heater did not appear to work. Although the bed was very comfortable we could not sleep at night because the blinds were inadequate and allowed outside lighting to stream into the room. We eventually hung our swimming towels up too.    On previous visits we have always found it very peaceful and relaxing and enjoyed sitting by the pool; this time it was awful there was a very large family who took over the pool and surrounding area. They shouted and dive bombed so that we could not enjoy the pool, this may have something to do with the policy of allowing children to stay free!    The WIFI was good when it worked but we were without it at least 3 times for 12 hours at a time, very frustrating.    Overall good value and nice staff but marred by the above niggles. biff75 wrote a review Aug 2015\n",
      "40 Relax We have been coming here for about ten years now and prefer to stay here over any other hotel in Pattaya. Though it does not have a restaurant and many of the other hotel luxuries. It does have a homely feel. All apartments are well equiped and the beach is literally a stones throw away. Decent prices and kind staff. Very nice pool and very clean throughout the grounds. Extra beds are available and parking is free. Though public transport is only 50 meter away on the beach road. Weekends are busy and noisy because of the Bangkok crowd on the beach.

      "50 Pleasant Stay We , i.e. 4 year old son, wife and II, had a short 4 nights stay here. We took the AOT Limousine service from Bangkok Airport to reach this place ( charges Baht 3100 ). Took about 2 hours to reach. The apartment is on Soi 9 - off Jomtien Beach Road on a fairly quiet part of Pattaya.  Staff was very friendly and they had everything ready prior to our arrival and we were moved into our apartment within minutes of reaching.    Apartment is tastefully done up. Living area is spacious, with sofas, a small dining table, study desk and TV. Adjoining balcony is spacious too with cane chairs and table. Apartment was well lit.  There is an efficient kitchenette with microwave, toaster, electric kettle, pans, dishes, crockery, glasses and sundry kitchen ware - sufficient to cook meals / breakfast etc. This was important for us since our son needs home cooked meals. The counter is tad small - but manageable.    There is free WiFi - though flaky at times. But we were able to browse, watch You Tube and make Skype calls.    The beach is quite close ( 2 minutes walk ), lots of convenience stores around, tons of eating options close by, bars etc. Also - there is an interesting night market close by.    We were also happy with the beach. Lots of families with small kids around. Nice beach for both adults and kids. Great place to relax and generally have a lazy family holiday. Weather was great - sunny but not warm or muggy. Prateep M wrote a review Jan 2015\n",
      "20 Not all bad but poor service & overpriced. The good:    -very close to the beach (100 meters)  -rather big room / living room    The bad:    -Poor design of the rooms. Room is small, living room is big. Sadly there is a wall between the two.    -At 1200 bhats it would be good value. For 2000 you can find much better in Pattaya.    -As we left, my girlfriend asked the reception for a taxi. She was told by some lady they could only get us a pickup truck, no air conditioned taxi. I called back to ask how it was possible and was told \"they didn't have a number for anything else\". We of course found an air-conditioned taxi in the street in 30 seconds, there are hundreds of those in Pattaya. This did not leave a good taste in my mouth, to say the least.

I would stay again no problem and room rates are great.Staff are very helpful and friendly. Check it out . PAB61065 wrote a review Sep 2014\n",

      "50 Great value for money During my recent trips to Jomtien, I always stay at Jomtien Beach Residence. It is close to the beach, nice and friendly staff, good quality of apartments. It is like home away from home. The apartments are nicely decorated, the beds are very comfortable and there is all what you need. You can easily cook in the apartment, although i prefer to eat at the local restaurants. Nice big balcony's with furniture, so you can relax and enjoy the view.  I can highly recommend this to everyone, who want a peaceful and quite place to stay. Bo H wrote a review Nov 2013\n",

      "50 very good value for money!! After searching for hotels in Pattaya for a family break, we decided to take a service apartment instead. We got an apartment with 2 bedrooms, big kitchen with eating area and living area. The only disadvantage was the big air-con in the liviing area was quite old so it made some noise. The hotel was in a very good location and convenient stores were near by. The beach was only a distance walk and few restaurants around there. There was a big swimming pool which was very convenient. The staff from the hotel were extremely friendly and helpful. tippistravel wrote a review Apr 2013\n",

      "50 Best food and service on Jomtien beach We highly recommend visiting Euro Asia restaurant. The food is good and The service super. The place is clean and the cheff is good. Prices between 100-250bath per serving. Don't miss it if You are at Jomtien beach. Gfiskers2014 wrote a review Feb 2017\n",
      "30 Ideal location just off beach Ideal location 2 minute walk to the beach, located at the bottom end of jomtiem beach. Basic clean rooms at a decent price. The local baht buses run regularly along beach road for popping into pattaya central at a price of 20bht. If staying in jomtiem again and on a budget I would stay here again.

      "10 Not trustworthy - avoid We spent a while looking at the rooms which are of a reasonable standard, agreed a weekly rate, made a booking for a specific room and left a deposit.    We went back 2 days later to check in and paid enough to cover the first night. We were asked to pay for the full week but we never do this just in case there is a problem. Only then we were told that our room was gone and they were now full due to taking Bangkok people because of the floods.    However, the owner told us she managed to get us a room - but this turned out to be a shabby room across the road at S P Guesthouse, and certainly one we would not have chosen.    We felt we had no choice, as we had paid for the first night by now, so left our bags and went on another trawl to see if we could find alternatives for the rest of the week. Luckily we found what turned out to be a much better deal in Jomtien Hostel, on a really quiet soi.    We think her story of taking in flood 'victims' was not completely true    1. Why didn't she keep our room and put the Bangkokians into SP guestthouse - which was not full? answer - SP is a grubby pit.    2. That evening there was no sign of life in any of her rooms, but the following night it was busy, so we think she had a late weekend block booking.    In the end she actually did us a favour as the Soi the Euro Asia is on is pretty noisy both day and night.    Getting bumped like this is something we really detest, and it wastes precious holiday time. Please don't support any establishment that thinks that this is an ok way to treat travellers.    Book Jomtien Hostel, the rooms are nicer, it's a very quiet location, you can get a balcony, they are very clean, they do a great breakfast and overall it's a much better deal.    Finally Jomtien Hostel kept their word, despite also taking in a lot of Bangkokians. Cheryl261 wrote a review Nov 2011\n"

I originally thought that i was booking Pattaya Beach area (hotel is listed under Pattaya Beach), but Jomtien Beach is farther south, much nicer, more quiet, and less crowded. Distance to Pattaya Beach is about 6km and there is very good, inexpensive transportation. The staff was very friendly. The only serious draw back about this hotel is that the room is really very small for two people Andrew K wrote a review Mar 2014\n"

      "40 Good but a bit far from anything Rooms were ok but you are a bit far from anything. No restaurant but there are several street food type places nearby and one of them made something incredible for me one night. Fairly quiet but the lift was out of service when we stayed. It is good if you have a car. The pool is good and this place seemed to be frequented by Thai families getting away from Bangkok for the weekend. Golf_Pro_Tour wrote a review Feb 2019\n",
      "40 Worth the money but has its flaws There are hundreds of hotels in Pattaya. Most are not worth the money advertised and in the high season, filthy hovels and outright pig accommodations charge crazy amounts. I will give my thoughts on this hotel. I actually like it but will give an honest assessment of positives and negatives. I apologize for the looong essay :)    POSITIVES  1.Location: this hotel is located on Sukhumvit road (across from the major Tesco Lotus store). That means it close enough to Pattaya Beach\\Walking Street but far enough so you don't have to listen to drunk people all night. You can take a baht bus to Central Road/Pattaya Klang then another one to the beach (20 baht total)    2. Amenities: It has a pool (looks clean) and a restaurant. Outside, its well kept and it has a security guard who checks all cars in the evening.    3. Price: although about 100 baht more than hotels in this range, its worth it. At first I was reluctant but found the extra money worth it.    4. Relatively noiseless: its on a residential street, you hear nothing at night (but see my note below)    NEGATIVES:  1. Service: I stayed about 5 days. The soap was not refilled and no toilet paper provided. But the room was cleaned mind you. They are simply cheap. I didn't mind because I buy my own shampoo but at cheaper hotels, refills are available. Go figure.    2. Towels: for 2 days, I was given towels that actually were damp and stunk. The reason was because when I stayed, it was cool weather-wise and they did not dry enough in the sun. I actually saw the workers try to dry to towels with an iron. Disappointing.    3. Kids: The owners kids are loud. While having dinner, they were shrieking. One morning, they were running down the hallways. Annoying but that is life.    4. Karaoke: as I write this, there is a man who has been testing the karaoke machine for 15 minutes. Saying Check 1, 2, 3 over and over. Thailand is a land where the concept of \"excessive noise\" does not exist and it is uncommon to have a restaurant boom at unhealthy levels.    I can see this being a problem. In the 5 days I stayed, no Karaoke was played. Today, before leave, its being blared. Its annoying how the hotel owners could allow this to happen. But Thailand is a land where things often don't make sense and its not worth arguing.    My suggestion: its not a bad hotel. Will I stay here again: probably.  Its actually a good hotel. Getting rid of the Karaoke nonsense, refilling items, and checking after maids to ensure they are doing their jobs can improve this place. praiseworthy2012 wrote a review Jan 2014\n"

      "20 Just an ok visit, with one terrible manager Have home in Jomtien but we had extra people come for holidays so I when to hotel. Booked with High Lords Residence and stayed 2 weeks in 2 different rooms. The two room were both \"family\" rooms, but what a difference, 1 bed was soft where the other was Very Firm. Wifi was very different in both rooms as well as television reception! So that was very disappointing to see two identical rooms with different features. House keeping was pretty good, but shower drain seemed to have some gas back up. On one occasion the hotel seemed to have \"lost\" my room key. When I was attempting to complain the \"manager\" had a fit and was way out of line. Come to find out that she had a \"fit\" right in front of the owner. I advised the owner of the problems I have occurred and of the managers lack of professionalism. She agreed and I did not see the \"manager\" for the remaining week... ??? maybe the hotel got tire of her S*#%?  Again with all border line hotels I would give High Lords another chance. Steven K wrote a review Jan 2020\n",
      "30 High Lords Residence: A Hotel or a Cafe? First of all, keep in mind that High Lords Residence cannot be found easily if you are coming from Bangkok in a taxi. It is located in Soi 7 and to be specific in the middle of Soi 7, opposite Family Mart cold store. it is located between a laundrey on the right and Moo restaurant on the left. There is no door but instead there is a cafe and restaurant which you have to pass to reach the reception. There is no visible sign of the hotel either.    Inside the Cafe, there are two counters, one for the restaurant and the second for the hotel. The lady at the counter is very friendly and efficient.  After registration, you must carry your luggage to the second floor where the lift is located.  Having said so, let me tell you what you get in a deluxe room. Amazingly, a deluxe room has all amenities of 4 star hotels. First, it has a balcony, a sitting room with a large LED TV set, an AC and a desk. Outside the sitting room, there is a small kitchen with a fridge, a microwave and cups and plates.  Then there is a bedroom; another AC and large LED TV set. The bed is soft and comfortable. The bathroom has a shower and it is clean. Downstairs the cafe serves breakfasts and lunch at reasonable prices.  Last but not least, you have to deposit 1000 Baht at the hotel.

      "50 Great hotel and value for money The website pictures don't do this hotel justice, it's 2 mins from the beach and 2 mins from the food market on second road. It's surrounded by condo's so nice and quiet however you have to walk past girly bars to reach it, as a male solo traveller it can become monotonous, a smile and a no thank you quickly works . I'm sure there are many though who think this is a bonus 😩.  The receptionist has to be one of the nicest in Thailand even offering to take my bowl of noodle soup to my room instead of seeing me struggle, a real asset to the hotel.  I booked a standard but was given a deluxe with separate living room, kitchenette and bedroom all for 850baht a night. Highly recommended. ThaiExpert wrote a review Jun 2018\n",
      "50 Highly recommended for a quiet stay in Pattaya. We booked this room based on the reviews in Booking.com and TripAdvisor. We stayed here 11 days.  From the port of Pattaya we took a scooter taxi to Jomtien Soi 7. For us a little weird to go through a street full of bars and anime girls.  We were kindly received by the staff of the Hight Lords and were given a large room on the third floor. In the room a large double bed, wardrobe with built-in safe. Furthermore, a low cupboard with TV. The bathroom was not that big, but with a separate shower part.  Outside a large terrace with a table and chairs.  The reception is always staffed and the staff is extremely friendly. They do everything possible to meet your needs. The room is cleaned daily and the towels are refreshed  The residence is very central. On the terrace there is a bit of music in the evening, but once inside with the windows closed you can not hear anything anymore. Just in front of the High Lords there is a supermarket (Familymart) that is open 24h every day.  In the vicinity there are several good restaurants.  Highly recommended for a quiet stay in Pattaya.

      "40 Nice stay Nice small hotel in the middle of Jomtien bar zone. Very friendly staff, and serves good breakfast. I stayed at the penthouse suite, which was a small disappointment. It's spacious, but the interior and furniture did not meet my expectations. I guess the smaller and cheaper rooms are more worth the price. Anyway, a hotel worth recommendation.

      "40 Location We had a room at the front with small balcony which was good for watching what was going on in the street. The room was large with a good size fridge, comfortable bed, clean bathroom. The staff were very good KittyK950 wrote a review Nov 2017\n",
      "40 Allaways back again Friendly Staff very big rooms. Everything around nothing far. We where there for the 3 times and we will defently come back again. Best value for your money. The large rooms is just like a 2 room Appartement. Lothar K wrote a review Mar 2017\n",
      "40 Palatial rooms in a seedy location My room is quite splendid, with thoughtful wooden furnishings and an extremely comfortable bed.  There is a large fridge,good equipment for making tea and excellent power bar with international sockets,thanks.  Best not to try to pay with a card unless you enjoy a big drama !  I do not recommend room 204,it is illuminated all night by signs from Family mart.Reception did not understand this problem.My preferences for rooms at booking were not considered.  Soi 7 has further deteriorated since April and is now given over entirely to purchase of female services.Unpleasant to walk at night if you are not in the game.  Good access to beach and all facilities.The street is quite peaceful and good for sleeping. dabarnes908 wrote a review Sep 2016\n",

Beds and bathroom okay and all these things at a reasonable price.Breakfast and meals are available at a seperate restaurant on the ground floor.  The hotel is situated in the centre of Jomtien Beach.  I intend to stay there again next year. Hans R wrote a review Sep 2015\n",
      "20 Dinghy place The amenities were there all right but was so so ..there are different lifts to take you to your rooms ,just seemed all so strange and not very appealing ,meaning dark and grubby...  The bathroom door is a distorted see threw glass ,,, so you can see people at there business ,,not really on is it..  Area is dark at night with a few girls bars around you..  It is close to the beach which is really its only good point..was full of noisy Russians when I was there,,also thought it was over priced..  Could be so much better but the layout of the lobby and the access to the rooms put me of right away..  Would suit some but certainly not me... leon9mm wrote a review Apr 2014\n",
      "40 Great hotel in good location We stayed in this hotel in March 2014 for 3 nights. The location is excellent with the beach only a couple of mins walk away, a family mart across the road, and only about 15mins from Pattaya on a baht bus (which costs 10 baht per person!). The room was large and clean with a really comfortable king size bed. We were given two bottles of water free a day, and we could have had it cleaned each day if we had wanted (but we didn't). We had to pay a 1000baht deposit on arrival which we didn't know and they would't take a card. The staff were friendly too. The room looked onto the street (soi 7) via a small balcony, which had two chairs and a table, but there was very little noise. The room also had AC, a fan above the bed, and a clean fridge! For the price we thought it was excellent! sbryce138 wrote a review Mar 2014\n",
      "10 Bad They not deliver what you did ask for. I had ask for a 3 person room, payed it and when i arrived they want extra money for the third person, while i had already payed and a confumed it. Never go there. Be careful if you make a reservsation there. victor k wrote a review Feb 2014\n",
      "40 Enjoyed my stay here Spent 5 nights here in Jan 2014. Very good location for beach, bars & restaurants. Room quite spacious, AC good, internet good too. Family Mart directly opposite the hotel.    I had a room with a small balcony overlooking the Soi, but its fairly quiet Soi to be honest, the only noise I had on 1 night was from drunk Russian guests also staying in the hotel. Eventually you hope, Russian people will learn how to behave appropriately, rather than coming back to the hotel at 5am, shouting & slamming doors. jaynewcastle11 wrote a review Feb 2014\n"

      "50 Very good The hotel is down a small Soi and about 100 metres away from the Beach. It's very clean, room are large, and good value for the money. Only downside is it has no lift so if you have limited mobility then this may be an issue. However, the staff are excellent and do their upmost to help. The hotel location is its main selling point. Would I stay there again certainly. littleiggy wrote a review Sep 2019\n",

      "50 Excellent Stay From the moment we arrived until the moment we left our stay was nothing but excellent. The Sunny Beach is a residence not a hotel but in reality it had nearly all the facilities of a hotel, including a basic complimentary breakfast. There are only two members of staff, Krit on reception and Ulai for housekeeping both looked after us extremely well and nothing was too much trouble. The residence is in a small soi just two minutes walk to the beach with plenty of restaurants and bars all around. The residence is small, approximately 10 rooms which give it a home from home feel, in fact a couple of nights\" being low season, we were the only guests. We had the largest room which was large... with big balcony the length of the room and a decent size bathroom with walk in shower. The rooms and facilities were spotlessly clean and were bright and airy. Excellent value for money. We will be staying there again in August. John W wrote a review Jun 2017\n",

      "40 Nice small hotel Sunny Beach is a small hotel within 50 metres of the beach at Jomtien. It is situated down a short side street off the beach road and close to many bars and restaurants. There are two very nice ladies who run the hotel between them and alternate between attending the reception desk and keeping the rooms spotlessly clean. No pool or restaurant but they do provide a light breakfast of fruit juice, toast and jam and Tea and coffee. The only downside I have to mention was being woken early in the morning by engine noise from two or three coaches searving the large hotel close by. MickB160 wrote a review Dec 2015\n",

      "40 Good all round hotel !! Great new Hotel. I found the Staff to be helpful, funny and always smiling. This made our stay more enjoyable. Also met the owner who took time to talk to us and ask if we had any problems and was genuinely a nice guy.  The rooms were very clean, modern, and had everything you would want.  Location is perfect for the beach as its approx 150 metres from the Hotel with bars, restaurants and shops all within metres.  My only suggestion would be the breakfast. A little more to offer and a varied variety would make this an excellent instead of a very good Hotel.  I would defo put this Hotel on my priority to stay list of Hotels in Jomtiem, a will visit again soon. Kirbs5432 wrote a review May 2013\n",
      "20 Only problem is the staff This is a newly constructed property. and the rooms are clean and spacious. the location too is great as its almost on the beach.  However... the staff really went out of their way to make our trip miserable.  To begin with when we checked in the staff did not help us carry our luggage to our rooms on the third floor through the staircase.(theirs no elevator). I thought that was really bad for a hotel of any category. But what did i know of what was about to come.  We had booked the room for one night and when we decided to stay in jomtien for another night, the staff came into our rooms at 12pm and demanded that we check out in 10min. we were sleeping that time and told them that we dont have another place and where are we supposed to go, but they said they didn't care and they couldn't extend our booking because they did not rooms available. But we checked on their website right then which showed 2 rooms were available. So it was a major disaster.  I strongly advise everyone to stay away from this hotel. ONLY because of the staff. aayushgx wrote a review Apr 2013\n"

      "40 Good location makes this a good choice... As I had nothing booked upon arriving in Pattaya, I had planned to head downtown to the Walking Street area in search of accommodation however, a chance meeting with a Norwegian (how often does that happen?), persuaded me to head instead for Jomtien Beach as it would be; 'more my thing', or so he believed.    And so we found ourselves outside Sunny Beach Residence.    Fesuccio, the owner was very pleasant and the rooms were both clean and tidy being fairly new in origin.    The real attraction however was that it was just off the main drag of the beach road so just that little bit quieter although...The THREE massage establishments next door could provide some very interesting if not fairly intrusive audible accompaniment to the mornings.    Overall I liked Sunny Beach Residence, in fact I rather liked Jomtien Beach having later viewed what Walking Street and Soy 6 had to offer. It was indeed nice to be able to walk away back to Jomtien when tired of the noise and craziness that is Walking Street.    Recommended without hesitation. London-Phil wrote a review Mar 2013\n",
      "50 Best value in Jomtien Sunny Beach is a brand new conversion of a shophouse into a small hotel. Clean, modern, quiet, friendly. Fast wifi in all rooms. Fantastic value at THB 1,100 (including a modest breakfast) in high season. A couple of minutes to the beach, shopping, and transportation, a couple of minutes in the opposite direction to the local night market and a great selection of street food, restaurants, and bars. Best value in Jomtien! Comparable hotels nearby charge THB 1,500 and up for the same level of service. Paul wrote a review Feb 2013\n"

      "50 Small hotel near beach I was here the second time and the staying was again very good. The hotel is very clean and the stuff is friendly. The hotel is not far away from the beach and many nice restaurants are in the surrounding.  You have free tea and coffee and small snack in the lobby, breakfast is not served.

      "50 Really nice family owned hotel Best stay we had in Thailand, really nice and helpful personell. Rooms are modern and clean. Local beach is just walk away as well as 7eleven. There is no breakfast but complimentary tea ,coffee and bread/jelly. But there are lot of small dining places just around the corner. Alar1972 wrote a review Sep 2018\n",
      "50 Away from the hustle & bustle! Lovely newish boutique hotel situated in a quiet soi just off the main beach road in Jomtien. Baht buses run up and down the beach road so absolutely no problems getting around. Stayed around Songkran time when Pattaya goes a little crazy so was great to be able to come back to a nice quiet area to relax. Nice sized rooms which were fresh and airy. Very friendly hosts and they have done a great job with the decor in the foyer where you can grab complimentary tea/coffee or snacks. Only complaint there was they never ran the air con in the foyer so always too hot to sit down and enjoy a cuppa; it is always stinking hot in April! All in all a wonderful stay and highly recommended. Camjar wrote a review Jun 2018\n",
      "50 Extremely well maintained Just had 3 weeks here, reviews were good and I went with them.  Spotlessly clean and I mean everywhere not just in the room! Owners were professional and always on hand to help and also respected ones privacy.  Very secure with key scan opening of front entrance so no one wandering around who didn’t belong there!    Location suited me as quiet, 5 mins to Soi 1 Jomtien in baht bus, 10 baht only and very frequent. 25 min walk to Soi 1 which I often did as walkways in Jomtien are excellent.    For value it’s 5 star no question.    If I was to be critical, it was WiFi and Tv, WiFi is poor in the rooms, did irritate me as I do work when I’m away, also TV English channels too few and quality of pic was poor!    I forgave the 2 hang ups as nothing’s perfect and I have rebooked already for 5 more weeks in Nov/Dec.    People make places so thank you to Krub and all his staff, I wish you success as a result of your hard work. In the same business so I understand the effort required to produce the results at this place. Andrew M wrote a review Mar 2018\n",
      "50 A modern value for money hotel with excellent facilities and great service I booked this hotel for 8 days as an alternative to another I was dissatisfied with and found it an excellent choice. The owner was very welcoming and extremely helpful. It's location was ideal being in a quiet road only a few minutes walk from the beach and the rooms were clean and modern with everything I needed. There was no tea or coffee making facilities in the room but these were provided in the lobby free of charge along with toast and various other snacks along with a microwave for guest's use. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel and will use it again in the future. keith d wrote a review Jul 2017\n",

      "50 All You need Booked this little Hotel for 3 days after being guest to a Wedding in Pattaya .  If you don't need a Pool (the beach is 2 minutes away) The Beachwalk Jomtien  Offers Everything you need. Spacious and very clean rooms. A little balcony , A/C, a frigde ,Safe, a kitchen sink ,free wi-fi ,TV and a bed which is worth to be called a bed.  The Facilities are in very good shape  The lobby Offers many little Details  (wakeboards, beach mats and Other little stuff which you could need for a day at the beach and Not usually carrying with on vacation)  The Host ( a sporty tri-athlete ) is a nice guy who always tries to help with any question you've got.  It may Not offer a Full breakfast Service  But you get Coffee/tea ,cereals and toast for free.  Would definitly recommend this stay and hope that Future guests will keep this all in the condition in which i got it presented.  Not like other stays I've seen here  Also it's taken care about your security,Front door opens only with your key tab when no one sits at the reception  During night time (but if anything occurs ,staff is just a called away) Dirk R wrote a review Apr 2017\n",
      "50 Mrs Irina It's excellent! We booked 5 nights but stayed 3 weeks.    For us it was ideal location, close to the sea but quiet.    Clean rooms, good balcony with sea view.    The owner is just awesome and speaks English. Helped us in a lot of situations. We travel a lot so we've experienced different attitudes.    Would definitely recommend to everyone going in Pattaya.

      "50 Amazing! Pattaya can be so trashy, but this hotel is like a classy island but with fair prices!  Everything looks nice and the place is very clean, rooms are comfortably big.  The staff is super friendly and helpful and speaks English refreshingly well. LIke the name says, it's within walking distance to Jomtien Beach, which is also a major plus. There's plenty of shops and restaurants around, but it's not as busy as the city center, which is good.  If I come to Pattaya again, I will not have to think about which accommodationn to choose. chrhab wrote a review Feb 2017\n",

Friendly atmosphere arranging whatever i requested. Would gladly stay here again if i ever come back to pattaya. Vidar O wrote a review Jan 2017\n"

      "40 Stayed four weeks, everything was up to par First, I had ordered a transfer from Bangkok airport to the guesthouse which was waiting when I arrived from Chiang Mai, and the ride took about two hours with a bit of traffic.    The owner Ket was there to welcome me and explain how everything worked.    My room was on the fifth floor with no elevator, but this is a guesthouse, not a resort, so no problems for me there, but if you mind stairs this may be a consideration. The room was large with a king size bed, bathroom with shower, fridge, TV. free wifi and aircon that could be adjusted. The small balcony was a welcome plus, but make sure you close the door when you go out there, especially in the evening, or the room will fill up with flies attracted by the light. Everything was kept clean, but you may have to remind the staff, then they get it done.    The owner wanted the hydro shut off (there is a card in a slot which you remove) while I was out. I complied, but it made the room hot if I was away for any length of time, but it cooled down quickly.    The wifi failed on several occasions for varying lengths of time, and there was no TV for two days as the cable connection was upgraded (or so Ket said). The shower had hot water, but very low pressure, so you got used to the steady trickle. Pattaya and Jomtien are very overbuilt, and the infrastructure has not kept pace. This is  Thailand, and expectations must be adjusted to reality, otherwise there were lots of 5 star resorts with corresponding prices for Western sensibilities.    My transfer back to Bangkok airport was spot on time at 7:30 a.m. to pick me up.    Overall I can recommend this guesthouse based on location, service and price based on what you are receiving.    Pattaya and Jomtien have a beautiful beach, but cannot be described as attractive towns, although they are very lively with lots of bars, clubs, restaurants and markets. The Jomtien Night Market, about a 15 minute walk away, is recommended. There is lots of very in your face sex tourism, but a little searching brings more sedate entertainment, and there are many tours to nearby sites on offer at any of the very ubiquitous travel agencies. The baht buses are on the go all day and offer a cheap ride for 10-20 baht to anywhere you want to go.    Jomtien is very popular with Russian tourists, so if you need a borscht fix in Southeast Asia, this is the place to come.      The owner asked wiederaufachse wrote a review May 2015\n",
      "10 WAY Overpriced - Decent amenities but too expensive This place has decent rooms by western standards, but compared to many other places in Pattaya it's more like the Taj Mahal. Nevertheless, this place is extremely overpriced, despite being a decent place. For whatever reason, some of these owners of hotels and guesthouses in Thailand seem to think that just because their place is not as dirty as most other places then it means they can jack up the prices. And that's not a fair way to do business. Gerbaud M wrote a review Oct 2014\n",
      "50 Great place 2 minutes from the beach on a quiet soi. Newly renovated guesthouse 2 minutes walk to Jomtien road and beach. The rooms are all different ranging from a massive 2 bedroom to regular king size bed rooms. The owner could not be more accommodating and helpful as well as speaking perfect English. Family Mart is just down the soi as well as other restaurants. You can walk to Jomtien road and grab a baht bus to go anywhere in Jomtien and all the way into Pattaya for 10-20baht. Even though there is not much going on in the soi it's very quiet, no music from clubs, no busy road or traffic of any sort. Even after we checked out we went to the beach and the owner let us go shower in one of the rooms before we headed back to Bangkok. The rooms were clean and large and wifi worked perfectly.  I would highly recommend this place. siriusstunna wrote a review Sep 2014\n",
      "50 Quiet and wonderful The guesthouse is fantastic, more than what we had expected. We had booked the family room and were surprised at how big it was! Clean and value for money, this place is walking distance from the beach. The area is quiet and Rosie made us feel very welcome. Will definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Pattaya. Sharmi17 wrote a review Aug 2014\n",
      "50 Colorful, Enjoyable, Quiet, Relaxing Our experience is more than what we expected from what we saw and read from reviews and blogs. Upon entering our room, we were amazed by the new smell of the interiors and very beautiful - huge accommodation of the guesthouse, the staff/owner is very sweet, caring, understanding and friendly. As much as we wanted to stay longer, we bid farewell to the owner. Indeed, we will recommend this very affordable and wonderful guesthouse to our friends. LeoMarge J wrote a review Dec 2013\n"

I went with my family and enjoyed to the utmost..The staff were very friendly and helpful..The rooftop sky lounge was exceptional during the evening, with cool breeze and sea view and drinks..A must visit place, very worth your money..Thanks for the beautiful place..Will visit again and again..ADDY K Addy wrote a review Oct 2019\n",
      "10 Avoid This Hotel. Bad Owner. No responsibility Booked room via Agoda 1 days in Advance and got email reply from hotel. But when arrived at hotel 4pm to check in. Hotel said I donot have your booking! They insist room is full. It took them a long time to solve problem after I got angry. 5 people try to lie snd explain many stupid reasons of no room. Finally, they managed to give me a used room by another guess. I said its used room, then change bed sheet for me, they wont do that until I shout. They ask a rude maid to do that. Maid kept complaining all the time, very rude lady. AVOID THIS HOTEL if you want to relax, happy, no hassle, upset while you want to enjoy holiday. Dirty small pool as water not clear at all. Cheap room and near beach but stay away from this hotel. Snowgirl_555 wrote a review Jul 2019\n",
      "50 Allways perfect ! We stayed in the sun sky resort many years and we come always back because the stuff is so so friendly and so so warm to us!    The rooms are very clean and the location is perfect!    The housekeeping is also perfect!    After a long flight from Germany it is for us same same to come home..... 🙏    Thank you very much for all 🙏    We see us for sure again 👍    Kind warm regards from Germany    Maurice and Chatchawan from Room 407 mhalcour wrote a review May 2019\n",
      "40 Five years on, another another stay. Efter about five years since our last visit, when the hotel had just opened, we returned for another stay, and we were not disappointed.  It does have its faults and quirks, but that is not why i subtracted a point.  It was the fact that there has been complaints by several other reviewers since a long time back, and these issues had not been properly addressed during our stay.  One point especially worrying was the state of the underwater lighting in the pool.  Perhaps it is 12V DC lighting and non-lethal(wishful thinking on my part), but the management really should make sure that someone professional secure it properly. (see photos)    That said, the staff was wonderful, really kind and helpful. A friend who had visited our room had lost her keys, and the maid went through all the sacks of garbage to see if they had ended up there, no hesitation or complaint.

      "50 Nice for holiday This hotel is very nice. Very friendly and helpful staff. I got sick one day before changing hotel and say helped me with going to hospital and told me i needn't worry if i had to stay there. They take care of suitcase. Fortunately i needn't stay at hospital but good to know that they take care. The bathroom is fantastic and the rooms have a good size. Very quiet hotel so you i had a nice sleep before going to Pattaya. I can highly recommend this hotel. Will come back here TiLoe wrote a review Nov 2017\n",
      "50 The place is well taken care of and good location near the beach I like to stay here the place is well taken care of by the staff and clean. The internet is not bad. They are currently building a restuarant on the upper floor so that could be interesting, not that there are not enough restaurants near by. The prices seem to be going up which is a little off putting but it wont stop me going back. billytom69 wrote a review Mar 2016\n",
      "30 Clean room near to beach Easy to find on Soi 9, only 30 metres from Beach road and 7/11 shop. Room was clean and spacious and was adequate for a few nights .No food or drink available at hotel (not even a fridge with water/coke/beer in reception). Cleaning staff very good but reception not so. Had to pay B500 key deposit and then they would not give money back until I produced the carbon copy of the receipt they had given me, in addition to the returned key card, which required me to unpack the car and search through the cases to find where I had put it. Whilst my family and others were using the small pool one of the pool lights floated to the surface causing a bit of panic to exit the water. Reception did not seem to care and had to be told more than once to get the maintenance guy. He arrived 5 mins later and prodded the floating light (which appeared to be smoking/steaming) with his finger BEFORE he went to switch off the power. 10 mins later, having re soldered the wiring, he replaced it in the pool and switched the power back on. Other lights ok this one not now working at all. Did not watch any more, but noted the following evening people were swimming in the pool all lights except this one working meaning the power was switched on. We did not use the pool again, not wishing to become one of Thailand's \"Accident\" statistics John B wrote a review Mar 2016\n",
      "50 Great location, even better hotel and staff! We were here with our family (1x10 month old and an elderly women) for 3 nights.  For the price you can't beat it. It's close to the beach, close to a convenience store and the staff are all friendly and extremely accommodating.  We will be back if we are ever in Pattaya. rkotlowski wrote a review Jan 2016\n",
      "50 Will stay again. ..☺ Very nice location close to family mart and 7/11 and very close to beach. Hotel is clean ,staff is helpful rooms are very clean also close to night market . Hotel has a small pool also . Many eating joints nearby  No problems during our 3 day stay..☺ Rajeev mehra wrote a review Jan 2016\n"

      "40 Nice rooms. Quiet location. This is not so much a hotel as a set of serviced rooms. However there is a front desk, small splash pool and a small reading area. The room is clean, bright and nicely furnished. A shower and toilet - no bath. A small balcony overlooks a patch waste ground home to a pack of local dogs. It is a potential building site, but there is no sign of any immediate development. That's not true of the beach front where there are major works to redevelop the sea front path including new sewage systems and storm drainage. It makes the immediate beach noisy and not easy to access right now. However you can jump on a Song Thaew (pickup taxi) and go to the end of the beach road where it turns into the centre of Jomtien. The beach continues on a very quiet road. This is the so-called \"gay\" beach but \"gay friendly\" describes it better. Straight couples use the area - it's fine.    Back to the room - I missed a closet and drawers for clothing. There was just a space with a rail and a few hangers. Otherwise all was OK. The room was made up promptly every day and to a very good standard.    You can get laundry done opposite at WIlai guest house and they can also arrange transport to and from airports. Lots of cheaper guest houses round here but not the same standard of decode. There is a lift and all rooms are wheelchair accessible.    I slept well with no disturbances. I much prefer to stay in the quiet part of Jomtien - it's easy enough to get to the noisier bits of Pattaya. Good value at about 1200 Baht a night David W wrote a review Nov 2015\n",
      "40 Quietly located in Jomtien The hotel is tucked up a side street off the beach road in Jomtien away from the excesses of Pattaya. The room was very pleasant, modern and clean with a balcony looking over a vacant plot of land (no sign of building works as at August 2015). Parking is limited but the side street has sufficient for overflow.  The area is less frantic than Pattaya with a number of tourist restaurants and bars close enough to walk to. Good wi-fi.  I would stay again when in the area. A car, whilst useful, is not essential in this area as the tuk tuks on the beach road reach as far as Pattaya and can be booked for longer journeys. Dolphin712 wrote a review Oct 2015\n",
      "50 Cleanest hotel by far which can't be said about the beach. The rooms cannot be faulted. Spacious bathrooms and massive bed. Views overlooking the waste ground is beyond the Hotels control. Pool was small but did the job. Lobby was OK with fast desktop internet. No breakfast. Beach was littered with discarded plastic at the time when we stayed and many russian men in budgie smugglers flexing their muscles and drinking beer. Again not the fault of the hotel. martinryder1956 wrote a review Apr 2015\n",
      "50 Friendly, Clean, Spacious and Excellent Value I stayed here with my wife and daughter for 2 nights. This hotel is very near to the beach, just a 5-minute walk. Jomtien beach is more quiet and relaxing than Pattaya beach but you may expect to take 2 times of songtaew (public vehicle) from the Pattaya Bus Station (from BKK) to this hotel. It's not a problem at all as i located this hotel by using google map with my smartphone. The guys at the reception is friendly and English speaking. There you will find 2 Mac if you like to surf the Internet. The room is spacious and clean with well selected decoration & furniture, and free wifi service (fast speed) with daily reviewed password. The bed is large and with 4 pillows. The toilet is clean and well maintained, my wife like it very much. One of the room setting i like much is that It has a large storage space besides the entrance in the room where we could put all our stuff like packback, luggage, shoes, clothes, buoy, slipper (when sticked with sand) before you go further into the \"bedroom\", so it would not mess up with the bed. A electric operated safe is also fixed there and it works without a problem. The balcony added its value that provide good place to feel the breeze and to dry your clothes. A table and a chair have already been placed there too. The outdoor swimming pool is clean, less people using it. A good alternative if you don't like going to the beach but it's a kind of cold starting from the afternoon. The amazing thing is it has a Water Standard Indicator board that shows the pH value and chlorine concentration of the pool water. All in all, it's excellent place to stay although there is no beach view. Chris L wrote a review Jan 2015\n",
      "40 Luxury at value for money I was at this hotel with my friends for 2 nights and 3 days. This hotel is 5 mins away from Jomtein beach, many convenient stores are located near by. Hotel also has small swimming pool, I must say that the rooms are very spacious, clean and well maintained, balcony adds up the rating.    It is 20 mins away from walking street, but rented bike is easily available to zoom in and around .hence its away from hustle bustle which gives peaceful atmosphere. Shoaib Sayed wrote a review Dec 2014\n",
      "50 Excellent little gem We stayed at the sun sky resort for 16 days and what a beautiful small hotel it was. The rooms are large and airy with a lovely balcony which had a small table and chairs the beds were very comfortable and the shower room very modern and stylish. The rooms are cleaned to a high standard every day and the staff were all very pleasant and helpful nothing was too much trouble .the beach is 2 mins away and local shops and bars are all within yards of this small modern hotel ,it has no eating facilities although tea and coffee is available in all rooms There is a small swimming pool but this does not get any sun after 2 pm and there are only 4 sunbeds it is kept clean but is possibly only good for a refreshing dip after a hot day at the beach only one drawback with this hotel there is no wardrobe to hang clothes and no shelves to put anything on other than that everything was excellent we had a wonderful time and would certainly stay there again very good value or money booked with agoda kween123 wrote a review Nov 2014\n",
      "50 New and Clean + Good value The rooms are spacious, everything is new and well taken care of and very clean.  The hotel is also very close to the beach. For the price, you can't beat this hotel if you want to stay in Jomtien. The road it's on is a bit of a side alley but not unpleasant. billytom69 wrote a review Nov 2014\n",
      "50 Great Value Modern, clean hotel almost right on the beach and an easy walk to shops and restaurants. Comfortable bed but had a bit of trouble with the Wi Fi and no beach view. Key changed every day - would have been good if they told us. Great value for money would definitely stay again. Jill W wrote a review Sep 2014\n",

I could not say a bad thing about the Hotel, Check in was very quick and the room totally clean, Comfortable bed, Good TV and air Con, All mod cons, Kettle with Tea and coffee, The hotel has a Swimming pool with only 4 sun beds, but didn't see many people using the swimming pool, plus the pool area was in shadow after 2pm.  45 seconds from the beach, 7/11 and other shops close by, 3 minutes to the Night market.  I liked the lift with the Glass door and the Apple computers for guests to use even though the WiFi was good,  I can not fault this Hotel, its New, Its all mod cons and value for money.. malct wrote a review Mar 2014\n"

      "40 Good basic hotel What impressed me about this hotel the rooms were very well decorated and maintained  It is very close to the beach.  Also ,and very important to me the rooms were very quiet.  No noise from adjoining rooms,above or below.  Good size rooms,with balcony,tea and coffee making facilities and a good size fridge.  Bed was on the hard side ,but I like it that way.  Bract rooms were clean ,good shower ,and very well maintained.  The price of the room is also excellent.Varies from 1,000 baht to 1,400 baht depending on season and weekends.  I found the staff on the front desk very friendly and helpful.  Many thanks for an enjoyable stay  No food facilities at hotel ,but lots nearby. danpat50 wrote a review Feb 2014\n",
      "40 Clean and Comfortable I stayed for four nights and was impressed with their large, clean and comfortable rooms. A standard room is easily acceptable with a fridge, air con, TV and perhaps the quickest Wi Fi I have found in Thailand. Located just across the road from Jomtien beach the resort is surrounded by restaurants, convenience stores and small bars. My gripes are minor: no plugs for shavers or hair dryers in the bathroom and tiny shelves in that room to hold toothpaste, brushes and other toiletries. Generally though an excellent place to stay if your visiting Jomtien. PaulW502 wrote a review Jan 2014\n",
      "50 Brand new and fresh Stayed here for a couple of nights, the place is brand new and well equipped, nicely decorated and in general very nice. The staff is pleasant and helpful. A misunderstanding when asking for a late checkout (15.00) resulted in a minor disagreement and argument but the poor staff agreed that she had not been sufficiently clear in her explanation of the charges involved, and an agreement was reached without problems, very professionally handled by the staff. Recommended and would happily stay here again! TrasteTh wrote a review Jul 2013\n",
      "50 Excellent value for money We stayed at this hotel for two nights in July. The hotel is one building away from the beach, so there is no sea view. However the hotel has just been revamped and is nice and modern, spotlessly clean and has internet access. Tea and coffee in the room and a nice modern bathroom.  The beach is a minute away, across the road. Jomtien Beach is a safe swimming beach which is next to Pattaya, but the beach is wider and cleaner. There are many bars and restaurants all along the beachfront. This is a nice area for families with children as well as older couples who don't want to enjoy the wild nightlife of Pattaya every night. Pattaya is only a short songtaew (pronounced sontell) ride away for 10 baht anyway.  The rates are low, but we did stay in the week and in the slow season. However this resort offers excellent value for money. Parking is free if you have a vehicle. There is also a nice swimming pool.  Just a block or two away is a small night market, for those ever important gifts for family back home. Ann T wrote a review Jul 2013\n"

      "10 Terrible, would not recommend. I stayed at this hotel for 3 days and I was very disappointed. When I arrived I was told that my room was given to somebody else. Even though I had booked a large room in advance. Instead I was given a small room and was promised that they would give me the bigger room the next day. However when I asked the next day I was again told that the guest who had our room had prolonged their stay. What I do not understand is why they gave our room to other guests? Anyways, the floor was dirty. I had to wear shoes inside to avoid getting dirty. Our room was not cleaned a single time while we were there. We did not get blankets or enough towel for the three of us and had to ask for this. Toilet paper was only given once if not asking and no water was provided. The room looks nothing like it does on the Internet. Worst hotel i stayed at in my life. At least I was charged less as they could not give the room they promised. No lifts in the hotel. Siri K wrote a review Aug 2015\n",
      "50 Everything is OK The room was simple, but everything worked well. I stayed at hotel Welcome Marina only two nights and really enjoyed the my holiday in Pattaya. Just 30 meters walk from hotel to the beach, night Market is only 15 minutes walk on the beach road. Near the hotel has everything what you need. And of course the price for a triple room is so reasonable. leolao78 wrote a review Jul 2015\n",
      "30 Ordinary Hotel It's have no blanket, the room look to old, but hotel is near beach. Everything is quiet (Place, People, Staff)...No security guard (It's make me afraid for my belonging) because my door can't close properly. Kathy999Thitiya wrote a review Jul 2015\n",
      "50 Nice Place to Stay in Jomtien I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights in May 2015. The hotel has an excellent location. Very easy to reach the city center. Thai staff was very friendly and smiled a lot. The hotel restaurant serves international cuisine. All dishes by 50 baht. Big and so tasty dishes. Robert_Epine wrote a review May 2015\n",
      "40 Good rooms These Russian hosts have a couple of buildings in the neighborhood. We had arrived at our location but was told there are better rooms in another building in the parallel street, just a short walk away.  The room we were shown to was good, clean and neat. Probably because this was newly constructed. I am not aware of their rooms in the other buildings. THe bathrooms were neat and clean as well.  The only disadvantage was that there is no lift and you have to lift all your bags up. There is also a small pub downstairs so for whoever planning to retire early in the night, this might not be a good place.  The beach is visible from the place and is just a short walk away. All the authentic thai food places along with plenty of 7/11s are here. shilpap wrote a review Oct 2013\n"

      "40 Value for money and good location The Cold Rock Apartments are situated on a road which leads to Jontien beach, and nearby the apartments are several very cheap restraunts. Our room was spacious and clean, with air conditioning, plenty of storage space, and a good shower with hot, clean water available 24 hours a day. The room also had a fridge, and wifi was excellent, fast and easy to connect. The location is quiet at night and we were able to get a good night sleep every night. Cleaning can be requested every day or less frequently which offers flexibility, and clean towels and two bottles of water are provided each day. The apartments can be booked daily, weekly monthly or yearly. We did experience a problem checking in which was due to a misunderstanding of who we had booked through, but once we settled in we enjoyed our stay here. This is a good place for people on a budget to stay, and away from the noisy bar and nightlife areas to allow sleep. However, it's still easy to get a baht bus into Pattaya or to Jontien nightlife areas if you are looking to party. mightyman246 wrote a review Feb 2016\n",
      "20 There was a better time for this place Cold rock apartment is located in Chayapreuk road, a main road that directly goes to Jomtien Beach. The place itself is well located, not too close to the beach but very near from Sukhumvit road what is something very convinient if you are thinking touring around, will save you from the traffic that usually happens in Jomtien road beach avenue. I do not recommend for long stays maybe not more than 2 nights probably. The building and rooms they look very unattended this days, probably manager has changed. It is not about dirty, its more about a renovation. The room looks poor, the towels in the bathroom are very old. First night, the room full of mosquitos. Sleeping in the bed it all less comfortable, hard like a stone, very painful. Old TV, very noisy air conditioner, really a pitty because location is good.    PROS: Location.  CONS: the condition of the rooms and the building itself, really need a renovation, specially if we think about all the competitors around that they offer better installation at the same price.  No breakfast is included. No laundry or coin operated washing machine. Roberto P wrote a review Jan 2015\n"

      "30 Restaurant has significant gaps in the menu For a couple of evenings I enjoyed sitting out front and watching the world go by, the staff are very polite and friendly, so decided to have dinner one night. Makes a change to have Scandinavian food, except... no fish. At all. No Dory, Cod, or Salmon... so ordered meatballs, passable. The advertised footy wasn’t on. Not enough chilled white wine, would I mind having ice in it? Watched a couple arrive with suitcases and the owner couldn’t be bothered to get up and help them sort their room. Try harder please! Britabroad wrote a review Jan 2020\n",
      "30 Budget option The rooms above the bar/restaurant are being let out as an affordable option for budget travelers.  I arrived late in the evening and couldn’t find the guesthouse. Finally went to the bar to ask and was told that it was the correct place - they check you in while serving drinks to customers sitting at the bar counter. A different experience for me!  You walk through the restaurant and go up a flight of stairs next to the kitchen to get to the rooms upstairs. There were a couple cockroaches scurrying across the floor when I turned the lights on but didn’t come across any more after I killed both of them.  The room is a cheap option with lots of restaurants, bars and convenience stores around it. Good if you only need a room on a Budget. finendandy21 wrote a review Aug 2019\n",
      "40 Great value for money Rooms are spacious and clean. Bar downstairs is just sound. The boss Lars is Swedish and very helpful (he put a football game on for me)    Location is fantastic directly across from the beach. The room price was very modest and the staff are just lovely.    Anut is a top man, very helpful and arranged a late checkout for us.    Totally felt at home here.    If you are looking for a 5 star hotel for this price you are going to be disappointed. If you are looking for a lovely friendly and comfortable place to stay in a fantastic location then look no further.    Safe travels Kevin M wrote a review Mar 2019\n",
      "40 A great place! I had a week in a very comfortable suite. AC, safe, fridge,minibar,waterboiler, double bed, tv in my salon, wifi and three spacious verandas! One with sea view. And downstairs there was a lovely restaurant/bar, serving very nice food and the staff was exellent! It is not hard to see why this place where very popular, crowded with guests most of the time!  But it was not easy to buy a cup of morning coffee before opening at nine. From nine am to one pm, daily,there was a buffet with nice food at reasonable costs.  Across the street are the lovely beach, and there are shops and bars all around. So at Vickans you are in the middle of everything!  Sorry that they didn’t had an elevator, heavy to carry my suitcase up and down the stairs, after all I am in my seventies! Also I became a little upset on my day of departure, since I had to wait 45 minutes for the taxi (ordered three days ahead), in the heat, knowing that I had a flight to catch. Also my payments was very confusing at a couple of occasions, especially on the taxi fare when leaving. Ruth L wrote a review Mar 2018\n",
      "40 Small and busy Only went here for an afternoon beer to get out of the heat. The draught Carlsberg was beautiful and to entice you further there were chicken wings in a bowl on the bar - now who could resist. We spoke to a couple of ex pats who were regulars but there were mainly Norwegians and Russians using the guesthouse. Popular so they must be doing something right. davidwilliambarnes wrote a review Dec 2017\n",

There are tables on the opposite wall. We both had thai food, Did not try the Scandinavian food since I have had bad experiences from that menu previous.  We asked for spicy since that what's we eat at home. The food was ok more Bangkok style then spicy eesan style. Staff is ok but a smile would have been nice Oscar M wrote a review May 2017\n",
      "10 Tried to eat today but closed I passed by Vickans to eat today but the dining room was closed, they were building a huge bar in the front with 2 half round sofas opposite the bar that could seat 8-10, maybe good for group 8-10 but not for party of 1-2. Also the Swedish menu was gone they had a pizza menu in the front. Did not look inviting the sofas look like they came from a go go or karaoke bar, should maybe give a rustic Art Deco effect but for me it did the opposit. Could not find out why the dining room was closed and also if expect guest to sit in the sofas and eat the new pizza menu. There was no sign that they were closed for renovation so the whole thing was absurd. Also was a sign in the front about consulting but not what they was consulting in, very strange.

      "10 Visit Vickans Guesthouse food Visited Vickans since I was hungry for a bite of swedish food, I ordered the stekt fläsk med löksås, salted pork with onion gravy and boiled potatoes. I got my plate and the sauce had separated so it looked like someone had liked on my plate. The owner was there and he saw I looked confused and came to the table, I showed him the problem and the answer was it suppose to be like that. I told him he was wrong and he told me I could leave if I didn't like the food. They came with the check I payed for the unbeatable food and left, have not been back since that. You can judge by my picture what you think. This is a very typical swedish dish and as a executive chef my self I know it was bad and he should just have taken back the plate and not told me to pay for it and leave. Just the bad behavior from him was discussing. Oscar M wrote a review Nov 2015\n",

My room was fresh and bright and had a small, private outdoor seating area that overlooked the main road and the beach. Surprisingly, I found that outside noise was not an issue. All reasonable amenities were supplied.... fridge, coffee-making, free wifi and so on.    The location could scarcely be improved on - between sois 1 and 2 and directly opposite the beach, with a vast array of bars, restaurants, shops, currency exchanges etc within a very short walking distance.    Staff is pleasant and obliging and Lars, the owner, is a very friendly and affable host. This place ticks almost all the boxes. Peter F wrote a review Dec 2013\n"

      "10 Nightmare guesthouse There is rarely any staff on premises, and their sole housekeeper/clerk badgered my friend and I during the entire stay about shutting down the aircon unit whenever we left, even if it was just for a 5 minute trip to 7/11. Being that it took forever to recover, it made for an uncomfortable stay. Angry reaction when requesting clean towels, trash removal. Seems as if they want to collect room rental and then spend as little time and expense to provide even the most basic of accomodations.    Large rooms two blocks from beach, microwave and hot water for tea are the only positive. No parking, as advertised. Refused to honor GENIUS benefits from Booking.Com. There are many well run guest houses on this soi, avoid this one at all costs. burmajones1 wrote a review Feb 2018\n",
      "10 I have to cancel the booking.. I booked this place with Booking.com and after reaching there he didn't give us the room. It's very sad to get this kind if treatment. This place had a booking.com rating showing off a score of 8.1, I wonder why??! Archit wrote a review Apr 2017\n",
      "10 Bad I came there to find a room. I've been standing there for 10 minutes and ringing the bell and no one has come. I tried to found some staff around, but still no luck. I saw there trip adviser's award for 2014 with 8 points. Probably something changed. Ася П wrote a review Feb 2016\n",

And if you would like more keycard you must pay deposit 500 THB for 1 keycard.

      "10 Worst hotel ever. Not worth money. Not recommend to stay at all. Pro  1.Near 7-11 and Family mart    CONS  1.Old and dirty. Totally different from the picture in the Agoda    2.Shower room - once you take shower, its will wet the whole room because there is nothing seperate shower area to bathroom door.    3.Tissue - they use old tissue roll ( left only half ), when we ask from 1 more roll, reception girl ask us back \" Did you just check in?? No tissue in the room??. After 10 mins she comes with a roll of tissue with her pissed face. I said \"Thank you\" she just walk away with her pissed face.    4.Shower hose was broken. Just use for 1 second its broke!! And its wet the whole room.    5.Bed mattress is sagging.    6.Its very dark in the room even all of light turn on. Yunjungz C wrote a review Oct 2019\n",

      "40 Short over night stay over Stayed here for 1 night. Came there around 9pm and checked out 9 am next morning. The hotel is very clean and simple and well kept. I enjoyed my stay and it was worth the cost I paid. Not much transport in this area but we had our own car, so no problem for us. No breakfast at the hotel, but there is a large family mart right across the road so it's very convenient. Overall a good budget and comfortable place to stay over for a short trip.

      "40 Friendly and clean We spent 7 days in the B2. Even the receptionist doesn’t speak much English, with a little bit of patience and a dictionary she was always very friendly and helpful. Most important for us it was very clean and for the price paid I got to say very good. Free parking, WiFi and internet counting on top of the friendly service.  The only downside is for those who love the nightlife and wanting it in front of there doorstep. It’s a bit of a walk. About 5 minutes to the mainroad where you can catch one of the batbuses to get you to the nightlife on Jomtien Beach or in to Pattaya.  For us as Family, having a hirecar for our stay and looking for a payable place to stay for a week it was good. Dieter wrote a review Dec 2018\n",

      "10 I am sitting in my car You must be wondering why I started to review a hotel with \"sitting in my car\".  I just checked in to this hotel at around 01.30 A.M. The parking was crowded.  I double-parked my car with N gear and also asked the security guard if it was ok. I checked in and also asked for a late check out at 12.30 P.M. The reception approved.    And it is now 07.32 A.M. I am sitting in my car because they called me right at 07.23 A.M. to move my car.    This is the most terrible thing with the most terrible morning reception I have ever met. I ran to the counter to tell them which part of body he used to THINK.    If the management care enough to asked or wish to make the better service, feel free to inbox me.    The room was okay and I was so tired checked-in after a long Saturday.    YOUR MORNING RECEPTION IS THE MOST HORRIBLE THING FOR ALL HOTEL GUESTS.    Keep hiring uneducated and heartless staff, if you wish to scored lower and lower. Your guests will never forget your hotel.    **My first time at this branch**  And yes, it is a budget hotel I never expect anything but a good sleep.    Your morning staff is not deserved a 1 star rating. SamParami wrote a review Jun 2018\n",

      "40 Good deal Went there for four nights during a business trip to Pattaya. The room was clean, nice and very cheap. I was actually expecting much worse... only negative point is you need a car or motorbike to get there as it's a bit far from downtown. But for that price you can't expect it to be perfect. I recommend it. Gaëtan M wrote a review Jul 2017\n"

That's a point of my choosen.  Room quite small but good design with necked concret modern style.  There is good resturant by the beach not far with live music.  \"What a relax place\" I would say. guyboo04 wrote a review Mar 2015\n",
      "10 Worst hotel ever I went to Pattaya for a holiday recently and had booked a room in this hotel online. The online advertisement said the hotel is by the beach, and has a sea view. So I booked a sea view room. When I arrived at Pattaya, I hired one of the motorcyclist-for-hire to take me to the hotel. They were confused. They did not really know where the hotel was located. After some discussions among themselves, one of them eventually ferried me to the hotel. The journey took about 15 min from Pattaya town and cost THB 80. I was dismayed when I first saw the hotel. Far from actually being by the beach, it was located in the middle of nowhere! Apparently the beach is another 500 meters away on foot.    Check-in was a hassle as the receptionist was not well versed with English language. Eventually I was assigned a room. What was promised to be a sea-view room turned out to be a 'dump-view' room because right outside my window is a large dump yard! The sea was nowhere in sight!    Being not happy with the room, I decided to check out to seek a hotel nearer to town and the famous Jomtein beach. The receptionist was most unhelpful when I asked to check out. He refused to help me call for a cab and instead asked me to wait by the road side for a 'tuk tuk' to pass by. It was already dark then, about 7 pm and it was chilly. Despite several pleas, the receptionist still refused to help.    I stood by the roadside for almost an hour as many vehicles passed but very tuk-tuk actually passed that way. Those that stopped asked for as much as THB 500 for the trip to town (it is about 12 km away)! At last a cab pulled up and agreed to take me to town for THB 150 where I eventually checked into a more pleasant hotel near the amenities and attractions of the city.    I would not recommend this hotel to my worst enemies. Jimbocyberdoc wrote a review Jan 2015\n",

      "30 Cheap rooms out of town When you stay there you should have your own motorbike or car, otherwise you have a 10 minutes walk up to the main road (Sukhumvit), where the Pattaya Floating Market is and where you can get on a Baht bus to town for only 20 Baht. But that's only a solution if you know Pattaya and know how to use the Baht busses (connecting bus, etc ), otherwise you might get lost. I booked a room for friends, coz the hotel is near my house. The rooms are clean and quite nice and in low season they have promotion prices starting from 550 Baht per night up to 1,000 Baht. The design of the rooms is a bit strange. The walls and ceiling look like unfinished, because of the grey tone design. Near the hotel it's hard to find a restaurant where you can get breakfast or lunch. There is nothing in walking distance. But at the end, my friends were happy. They got a good place to stay and I was their driver. Actually this place is good enough for 1 or 2 nights, but not good enough to spend your holidays there, because of the location. Wolfgang P wrote a review Aug 2014\n",
      "30 Modern Boutique Style Hotel Unfortunately for the price this hotel is to far from the main thoroughfare of Jomtien Beach. You can get a songtaw or taxi but for a very high price between 200-400 Baht. The hotel itself I feel is comfortable, nicely appointed rooms and clean, but sometimes the house keeping staff are a little careless, especially the bathroom where they forget o remove the used soap of a previous guest. You also have to watch for ants and not leave food around.  The staff all do not speak English, but a couple do and try their utmost to service your needs. The disappointing part of my stay was threefold.    1. The morning I arrived the restaurant was not open because if there is a party the night before and there is nothing next morning for the staff to do , than they don't open the restaurant when they should, so I had to go for a long walk and find something that time of the morning which was about 7am. No choice.    2. If you have valuables like jewellery, money and passport there are no safes in the rooms not is there one at front desk. Which you have to cart the things around with you, and security out in the town is scary. I made the mistake of asking the front desk clerk to hold my passport and documents for me until I return in the evening and get them from her. Taking my documents was not a problem, but getting it back was a fiasco especially when I was leaving the next day at 6 am. I got back to the hotel in the evening and approached the clerk to get m documents and was told that they are in the money safe of the hotel and do I have proof they were mine and to produce the paper signed by the person and myself so that I could get them back, I said no I was not asked to do so, just to help the accountant advised the clerk to take them and put it in the safe. not knowing at that time the safe was only for money reasons. Thais do not give complete and precise information about situations so one is always left in a quandary. So at that point I blew a gasket and than was told there was only one key and the account has gone home and he lives 2 hours away from the hotel and will be back at 9 am next day, so there were 2 lies from the clerk. Now I needed my passport, how do I get it back, so I lost my cool and asked to get the guy on the phone and ensure he is back in a short time to give them to me . I was told to wait about 1 and half hours for him to return, wait in my room and she would call me. It was not even 15 minutes I was in my room, I got a call to say he had returned. I thought he might have come back by rocket, knowing my wrath, so I concluded that he was in and around the property to have returned in that short of time. Anyway he gave them to me without any further problems.    3. Please do not break anything in the hotel of spoil the bed clothes with wine or food, you will get charged for replacing and cleaning. I was a witness to this episode.    Also I requested a sea view room, don't bother to ask for it, you can't see the sea, its over the distant and trees and other high rise buildings are in your path. Never will I go to stay there again.Next morning I left but when I booked my taxi it cost me 400 Baht or you don't get one, for a 5 min ride to the bus station.

Next day we saw a new lady at reception and new lobby boy, this time staff were happy - Sawadee/ hello sir/madam etc.That was the way paying customers should be treated. Every time the original reception \"not happy\" lady was working everyone including the older lobby boy all were not happy!! Suggestion: Just smile at customer even if you not understand!!

      "10 My review is about the Tevan Restaurant and the bad food Dec 2015 I had walked past the restaurant section of the Tevan hotel just off Watboonkanjanram Rd on a number of occasion and noticed there was never anyone seated. I just thought it was my timing. I was intrigued to try there food as they have a brick built pizza oven displayed outside and there menu for pizzas looked good. However when I entered there restaurant for dinner I ordered the Veg Pizza and set menu with rice soup and chicken. The 8\" pizza the base had been burnt to bits and lacked taste. The so called tomatoe paste or sauce they had used for the pizza was watered done and completely tasteless. The brick built oven outside is a marketing ploy to attract people in as my pizza had the crust burnt to bits in a standard kitchen oven. The set menu the soup was OK but the chicken was tough and hard to eat and was obviously left overs from the previous day/s. Overall opinion total waste of money and poor quality, tasteless crap food. Golden1966 wrote a review Dec 2015\n",
      "40 good value of money This hotel is quite new and in good management, the room, beds, towels are clean and high quality, nice interior decor.There are not many choices for your buffet breakfast but the food is acceptable if you are not serious about this. A little swimming pool at the entrance of the hotel may relax you whenever you passby. the food served by restaurant is affordable and good enough, try TomYum Kung there ! at night time, you may walk to a small thai restaurant opposite, where the owner is always nice with smile and ready to serve you till 2 pm , food is not over charged here.  Pro: clean and spacious rooms  Cons: maybe over 1 km from Jomtien beach  Generally: good value of money, suitalbe for family and short stays Hao_MQ wrote a review Jul 2015\n",
      "40 One room resembled a store cupboard - no natural light This was a typical 3* hotel. We were comfortable, but one of our rooms (445) had no window, and was more like staying in a storage cupboard. No natural light is not a good feature, and when we stated our displeasure, we were told to take it or leave it. As we had already paid, we had little option but to take it. However, if we had known in advance, we would not have booked.    Maybe they should consider replacing the wooden balcony doors with glass doors. Neal O wrote a review Jul 2015\n"

      "50 In Jomtien Beach heart I stayed here for nine days. Great location not far from Jomtien beach, just in the heart of the city. Great helpful staff create friendly atmosphere. Big rooms are cleaned daily. Comfortable bed, good continental breakfast. Hotel has its own italian restaurant on a ground floor. There is no lift there so it could be tiring to reach the fifth floor. thurin wrote a review Aug 2018\n",
      "10 Terrible service Beware of staying at this guesthouse. Staff are rude, rooms not cleaned properly, WiFi doesn't work (every day they say it will be fixed but then it isn't), loud, noisy, mosquitoes in the room eat you at night. Very poor value for money. James H wrote a review Jan 2017\n",
      "40 Very good Stayed here for nine days early december . Great location . Clean spacey rooms . Food and drinks good and very cheap . Yim who runs the place for her mum was very friendly . Only gripe i have is that the safety deposit box was faulty so i was given a key to use on it rather than the pushbutton display which was fine until the key jammed and i got charged for the locksmith coming out to fix it . It was only about 12 pound but i didnt think i should have footed the bill but thailand seems to run like this . Other than that a great time had here and would stay again . Thanks  Barry Roane diggler wrote a review Jan 2017\n",
      "50 Great stay During a recent 4 week visit to Thailand I stayed at the Sunshine Guest House at Jomtien for 6 nights. I was very happy at the guest house, during check in I got upgraded to a bigger room with a king size bed, sofa, coffee table, fridge, kettle, this was unexpected and a very nice touch.    The staff at the guest house were all very nice and helpful. The room was cleaned every day, the restaurant at the guest house is very nice, the previous week in Phuket I had a bit of stomach trouble so when I was in Jomtien I was just getting back into eating properly again, I didn't want to venture too far from my room just Incase..... So with that in mind I ate at the Little Sunshine restaurant on my first night, I normally like to try different places but the food was so good I ended up eating breakfast and dinner there every night!    Massaman chicken curry was my favourite, also 45 baht for a beer, I think that's the cheapest beer I found in Thailand. Would definitely stay at this guest house again Lucas69 wrote a review Dec 2016\n",
      "50 Super stay This guest house is very clean.  The staff helpful. Very good location in Jontien near the beach and in a center of a lot of activities.  I will come back....  The rooms are large, with good equipements for the price Jessica wrote a review Feb 2016\n",
      "50 Good for the price Nice big room, clean. Located in a quiet area. Close to the Beach & to many restaurants, bars & massage shops. Car parking available. Nice hotel bar & friendly service. Easy access to the hotel. This is my first stay in the hotel & sure I will come back. Pierre W wrote a review Nov 2015\n",
      "50 Guest house very friendly and clean Cheap, friendly, and near the . beach.60 meters of the beach. This guest house have motorbikes for rent. Special price for guest.  owners and staff very cool.  i return in this place next time.  RReally good place for stay. very good price for this quality.  Only not lift . Jessica wrote a review Mar 2015\n",
      "40 slightly overpriced Nice but soft renovation, no exhaust in bathroom, which still has no separation from shower to toilet. So whenever you have a shower, there is water all over the place. Can find similar accomodation in the same soi at 200 THB less. Cesar B wrote a review Oct 2014\n",
      "50 Great Hospitality and Comfort I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Sunrise Guest House in Jomtien. This is not my first visit to the Jomtien area however my first stay at this wonderful little establishment.  The staff and management are just great, they were knowledgeable of the area and provided me with a lot of local information.  The rooms are clean and very comfortable and the management ensured that my stay was comfortable.  Frankly speaking I personally would recommend to anyone to stay at this hotel. The hotel is just a 3 minute walk to Jimtien beach, numerous restaurants, shops and local bars.  Looking forward to my next stay at this warm and comfortable establishment!

They also had a washing machine and kindly allowed us to use it for our laundry.    The food in the restaurant was nice and you're a 5-7 min taxi ride from the famous Walking Street, which once you get there you realise it's good to be a few kilometres away lol.

      "50 Wonderful accommodation... A lovely warm and friendly welcome from the reception staff made me realise immediately this was going to be a pleasant stay. I wasn't disappointed.  Rooms were exceptional. Very large, clean and comfortable with everything that you need. Good shower, very good WiFi, big TV.  Large balcony area, but nothing much to look out to. Kitchen inside which I never used. Free tea and coffee in room.  Pool area is very small but this can be seen in the photos so no problem here. Beach is only a short distance and towels can be provided.  Breakfast was totally fine, only a small selection but perfectly adequate. Food temperature was kept only aired which is something that could easily be improved upon. I asked for items to be warmed in the kitchen and this was done without any problems.  Overall it was a wonderful stay, in very pleasant accommodation with friendly staff that made you feel welcome and at home. We'll done to all concerned. Mark G wrote a review Dec 2019\n",
      "40 Amazing little Gem We ( myself, wifey & my 3 year old daughter ) visites this place from 30th may to 4th June2019. It is a boutique hotel with large rooms. The rooms are very nicely decorated with beautiful furniture and artifacts. Spacious and comfortable with kitchenettes and utensils. We had asked  a room on the 2nd floor but when we reached the hotel it came to our surprise that we were offered the ground floor room at first we were reluctant in taking that room as we had a 3 year old child with us n thought it would be noisy but then the reception lady said that they will shift us on 2nd floor the next day so we stayed on the ground floor but to our surprise there was no noice at all plus the hotel doesnt have a lift so we agrees to stay on the ground floor. The industrial size bathtub in our room was lovely and worked well. The locally made wooden king size bed was the most comfortable and the best  in functionality and originality. Ac & internet works very well. The hotel is tucked away on a side road and therefore it misses all the noise from Beach Road. Breakfasts buffet are adequate but what makes the place best is the front desk friendly staff. They are very kind and show the guests  genuine Thai hospitality. Each suite comes with a little balcony but being on the ground floor we never used ours. There is free parking place for your rented cars n bikes. The hotel also has a small swimming pool buy we never visited it. This hotel gets booked up so advance booking is recommended. As people discover this gem, they come back year after year as we heard some guests comment about staying there before. We had a fabulous time at this remarkable edifice. Would definitely love to come back here to stay. Mehernosh P wrote a review Jun 2019\n",
      "50 Loved This Hotel Great location, very near to the beach. Awesome inexpensive prices, lovely well maintained rooms and the best customer service I experienced during the trip to Thailand among all hotels I stayed at. Rooms are big, spacious and very very clean. The pool needs some improvements in order to bring up to the standards of the hotel, but is fine. johnnybaca02 wrote a review May 2019\n",
      "40 Very nice little hotel This is a very nice boutique hotel in Soi 4 with Jomtien beach in two minutes walking distance. The service is pleasant and helpful and is happy to help you book tours and transport. There are cafes, laundry and a 7-eleven in close proximity. We were given a large tiled room with large bed, newly remodeled bathroom and large tiled bath on the 1st floor, there is a kitchenette in the room with dining table and chairs. There is a cooking stove and fridge and good cupboard space. The room has a safe, air conditioning and is nicely decorated in Thai style. Simple breakfast is served and there is a small pool. The rooms and Hotel are kept clean every day. utpaatur wrote a review Mar 2019\n",
      "50 Perfect location, great room, great staff. Perfect location, great room, great staff. Definitely a place to come back, I really enjoyed to stay here, the only thing I have to appoint that i did not enjoy was the shower, warm water for a couple of mounts and very week water pressure. Apart of that everything was perfect. Note: If you enjoy a pool, this one can fresh you up but that's it. Antonio Lemos wrote a review Nov 2018\n",
      "40 Tucked away and Quiet Stayed in this hotel for one night room 207. I was pleased to see big rooms with self catering facilities, One nice touch was an electric mosquito control that accepts the little pads, there was three provided. The hotel was clean and staff were friendly. Only thing I noticed that the hotel should address is that the pillows although very comfortable they are looking old and browned, a wash or replacement should. That being said would use again as I believe the owners would address the issue.  Breakfast was substantial and cooked properly. Jimbo wrote a review Jul 2018\n",
      "50 Excellent little Hideaway Nirvana is everything my friends told me it would be: - immaculately clean, very friendly staff, large very well appointed rooms, excellent beds and a great shower.  Privately owned and managed by a Norwegian gentleman, it’s a type of ‘family run’ place and Soi 4 is a quiet, well kept and just a few meters from the beach. Quiet, but close to whatever attractions or action you could possibly look for. Erik-xVx wrote a review May 2018\n",
      "40 Great location My wife and I stayed in the Nirvana for 7 nights in April 2018 and thoroughly enjoyed our time there. The room (307) was huge and had a king size bed equipped with quality bed linen and mattress. The bathroom was equipped with a decent shower with loads of water pressure.    Okay, the hotel doesn’t have a lift but if you lack fitness or mobility the ground floor rooms would be an option. The small pool was also mentioned in a few reviews but we used the big one at the end of the soi with the sandy beach in front.    The location is also good food wise with loads of quality restaurants in the vicinity. bornanbred wrote a review Apr 2018\n",
      "20 Big Room, dirty. Stay away. Lot of noise from neighbor restaurants. Very simple breakfast, always empty something and had to ask for refill.  Room very dirty first day, had to clean out the wardrobe area yourself for dust.  The King Size bed had a wooden frame that you must climb over for getting in & out of bed.  Very big space between tiles on the floor, very hard to walk on without shoes.  Same in the bathroom with concrete?! bathtub. The shower had very hard pressure but almost no water coming out and when it came it was either very warm or cold.  Also big problems with insects at night because there were now insect net at the balcony door, and btw you couldn't lock that door either, the lock was broken. The hole room was outdated. Our biggest concern was the many bites we got all over our bodies. I suspect bedbugs, we have never experienced this before and we have been travelling many years in Thailand. The hotel was understaffed, with cheap solutions for everything. The manager, not sure what gender, I call it HEN as they do in Sweden, was a very rude person, but what can you expect from a former bus driver with no education.The Thai staff were very friendly. In the price range I would recommend either Jomtien Thani, only 50m away, or Aiyaree Hotel. The are more professional minded and have a better buffet and cleaner room and for many persons much quieter than in this Soi (gate). Also small stairs, no elevator and a swimming pool in the backyard in the shadow that no one used. Look big in the picture, but not bigger then a big jacuzzi. Save your money and find a much better hotel in the neighborhood. There are plenty of them. Odd123 wrote a review Mar 2018\n"

      "30 Big Rooms, Good Location. Nirvana has two distinct upsides. One is its location. Transportation into South Pattaya is cheap (10 THB), frequent and with pick up/drop off on the nearby Beach Road.    The other is the size of the rooms. They are large by any standard. The hotel looks like it was built or fitted out in the 1970’s and retains pretty much every original feature. A recent change in ownership promises a refresh; it wouldn’t go astray.    There is no lift so if you are not physically fit I’d seriously suggest a cheaper room on a lower floor. Breakfast was included in our room rate. It was perfectly acceptable. Fellow guests were quiet and pleasant. Staff excellent. The pool. Yes there is a pool; it’s rather unique and perfectly formed.    I’d happily stay a couple of nights here again. If you are looking for a cheaper hotel that is not scary and in a good, quiet location, Nirvana would be worth a look. KhunWilliam wrote a review Dec 2017\n",
      "50 Kind staff and great room! I stayed here while on my honeymoon; we had the deluxe one bedroom apartment. The staff were always helpful and kind (including a tour of our suite when we first arrived so we knew how everything worked!), helped us arrange day trips, and provided made to order meals for breakfast. The wifi was great in our room; I used the pool once and while it is not fancy and small, it was nice to have alone time by the pool since no one else was using it! The room was fantastic (loved the kitchen, huge bathtub, and balconies!) and it was one block from Jomtien Beach, which is full of great food carts. We definitely recommend this hotel spot! Kaitlin P wrote a review Oct 2017\n",
      "40 nice interior and location Original nice interior, clean, big room with cooking facilities, friendly personnel, very comfortable location: 5 minutes of walk to the daytime food market and 10 minutes – to night food market, don't be afraid of street food – it's very fresh and tasty; 10 minutes of songthaew trip to city center/Walking Street (the price is 10 Baht or 0.3 USD); 5 minutes of walk to Jomtien beach, but we would recommend to walk 20 minutes in city center direction to the area of luxury hotels of Cosy Beach – the water is more clean and the beach is more solitary and picturesque. The time interval for breakfast is wide – 7.30 – 10.30 – but if you miss the breakfast they don't provide takeaway option (I don't know whether other hotels in Thailand provide it). Be careful, not only this hotel, but most if not all hotels in Thailand have long list of fines for any damages or violations – so if you happen to see any damages/defects/lack of items in the room it's better to warn the personnel immediately. I have put the stain of mango on the bed sheet and the receptionist asked to pay fine of 300 Baht/10 USD for it, but I proved that this fine is not in their list and they forgave me :) Inna V wrote a review Sep 2017\n",
      "40 Good value and huge room/apartment We go here regularly (missed last year though) and always enjoy it. Harder work this time as we were up two floors and no lift - maybe because they are doing short term lets of apartments because its so quiet. But usual big clean room. Wifi has improved and is now pretty good. Breakfast is cooked to order which is nice an now you can take as much coffee as you want. Outsie has got greener too. Matt K wrote a review Jun 2017\n",

      "30 Not good, not bad Having read the reviews we accepted that the hotel could either please or disappoint us, it did neither. There were pro's and con's.  PRO'S  Good location in quiet Soi only 5 min walk to the beach  Very large rooms with kitchen area and small but adequate balcony  Clean rooms, however each day we did have to 'kill' a few mosquitoes  Breakfast had choice of six options with juice and coffee. The best coffee I have had in a Thai hotel for a long time  Pleasant and helpful staff, with the exception of bad start with the manager  CON'S  Rooms and public areas in need of a refresh, particularly the bathrooms  Shower had poor water pressure and was constantly running hot and cold  Glazed tiled floor throughout the room which was a slip hazard  The bed was comfortable however it was on a wooden base that that hash a 12 inch ledge all around which was a hazard to your shins. Even the bell boy warned us about walking into it, which unfortunately I did to my detriment and has the bruise to prove it  The corridors on all three floors had used stained mattresses laying against the wall, three in the corridor on our floor    Reference to the manager, upon check in we were allocated a room on the ground floor, despite requesting high floor at time of booking. We asked for a higher floor and were met with a very sullen and almost angry manager who muttered several words in Thai then told us the only other room was on the third floor and with no lift WE would have to carry our own luggage. We did with the pleasant help of the only male member of staff. Took two days before we could even get a smile from the manager. There are equally good hotels with similar prices in the area and we would look at these in future. John W wrote a review Mar 2017\n",
      "20 stuck in the past, filled with sex tourists I saw some good reviews without knowing that they were from sex tourists, that have much lower standard than normal people.  visualy the rooms are nice but that's it. I had 2 rooms, first one had 10 years of nails clipping and other Trash around the mattress that is at best a 100$ crap mattress from tesco.. really uncomfortable. the pullout couch had mold. the room smelled of cigarette and the sink in toilet had drops only while the shower was too strong(physically painful). the front door and patio door are semi open so noise and smell have 0 buffers. the second room which was more expensive had a a couch that smelled like fresh diaper pee. they wanted us to pay 500b more per night for an extra mattress to replace the pullout couches.. yet that mattress was just as smelly and worth maximum 1000b.. cheap crap.  they use a single 10/1 dsl line in 2017 for the whole hotel, you can barely do anything on it and the WiFi itself kept crashing. A fiber line costs 600b or 20$ per month.. they are saving themselves 2 or 3$ on this.  they also only change beddings every 3days.  the beach Is awful.  the customers are dirty with fresh 40 yo hookers with them in the morning breakfast area.  have nothing positive to say.. worst hotel of my life.

      "40 great location, reasonable price, amazing rooms Having visited Pattaya on two previous occasions, this hotel is by far the best I have stayed in in terms of location, price, comfort, and amenities. Located steps away from the beach and the hundreds of restaurants, bars, massage parlors, and shops which abound in Jomtien beach. The rooms are enormous and include a balcony, king-sized bed, kitchenette, and giant bathtub. The design and décor of the rooms are very tasteful and beautiful, the bed is extremely comfortable, and all amenties (with the exception of a microwave oven) are included. Breakfast is also included, and while far from spectacular, it’s OK. On the downside, there is no fresh fruit served with the breakfast. Also, the TV in the room is quite old and has no USB port for plugging in an external HD, for those travellers who bring along their own TV shows and movies.  On the whole, the staff is very friendly and helpful, with the exception of the afternoon shift. The woman who takes over the front desk in the afternoon is extremely unfriendly and unhelpful. We literally had to fight with her to get an extra blanket. She absolutely refused to give us one. Unbelievable! There is also a resident kitten which has the run of the hotel. So anyone with cat allergies and cat haters would be advised to stay away. Edward S M wrote a review Dec 2016\n"

      "40 Large rooms and close to the beach Stayed here for 2 nights as was doing scuba diving with a local shop. I booked the deluxe room which was very large and felt like my own apartment - open plan living, dining, kitchen area and bedroom can be curtained/screened off, if necessary. Was impressed with the size.    Styling was quite nice (which was one of the reasons I picked this place) but the finish isn't high quality. Big gaps in floor tiles and pebbled bathroom floors made walking with bare feet a bit painfull plus it was also quite slippery on the floors (again bare feet), especially the wooden frame around the bed. If I could change one thing, I'd get rid of the concrete bath tub as it just doesn't look nice and isn't practical as there is no shower hose and no one would really want to bathe in that. Generally clean though a bit dusty here and there.    I saw many reviews about a \"rude manager\" and although she may be a bit introverted, she was absolutely lovely, smiled and was not rude at all. So without knowing the details of all those other reviews, I don't have anything bad about her or her staff to say.    Breakfast started at 7:30am but I never tried it as I had to leave by then for my dive, so no comments. But in room, they provided 2 complimentary bottles of water each day and had my own kitchenette, fridge (no microwave) and the location is on a side street. I tried room service once and that was fine. The menu looks the same as the restaurant opposite the hotel.    Location is great. I was a lone-male, so got pestered a bit by the massage shops but if you just keep walking they'll ignore you. But the main beach road is less than 3 minutes away and you'll find 7elevens and all sorts of shops and restaurants.    If the prices remain reasonable, I'd certainly consider staying here again.

      "40 Neat, clean and customer friendly. Arrived around 10.30 am on the check in day and we were straightaway given a room without being charged anything extra for early check in. Room was neat and clean with 2 complimentary water bottles, in room electronic safe, dining table for 2, gas, microwave, refrigerator and mini-bar. They have room service as well, we ordered some food and i guess it was made from some local restaurant around and delivered to the hotel and our room. Wi-Fi was pretty good. Staff were friendly but not very good with English. They arranged for a taxi to Bangkok (right up to the desired destination) for THB 1,500 but the driver was also not good with English and directions within Bangkok. Didn't get a chance to even look at the pool and we skipped breakfast on the next day so cannot really comment on that. TBH 10 bus always available from outside the Soi to get to Pattaya Beach and Walking Street. There are also money exchange, shopping, 7-11, restaurants outside the Soi. Beach at a minute's walk. Definitely recommended for the quality, service and safety. ManishLaungani wrote a review Aug 2016\n",

This beach is not too clean so we go to a private beach called SaiKaew Beach run by the navy. You need a car to get there it is about 30 minutes away. roohi m wrote a review Feb 2016\n",
      "30 location location Located on soil 4, was good , close to beach/rumpho market nr immigration office but was quiet and close to the action. Staff friendly and rooms cleaned efficiently. Some furnishings looking tired but large room/studio. Breakfast was ok but finishes at 10:30. Would visit again. rickuk56 wrote a review Feb 2016\n",
      "40 Hidden Gem Have just had 10 nights at the hotel and it was an enjoyable experience. Location is great - nicely tucked away just a minute from the madness of the beach and main road. The place has character which I appreciate. Sometimes the staff are smiley, talkative and friendly, sometimes not so, but they are never rude or off hand. Just normal people working hard in a non chain, non corporate hotel. Very good large rooms, extremely comfortable bed with high quality linen. Good bathroom, decent shower, excellent aircon, good supply of bottled water and tea and coffee. Good housekeeping standards. Breakfast is a la carte and really well cooked (special mention to the lady chef), piping hot and tasty. Serve yourself coffee and juice so as much as you need. I was made to feel welcome and that my business was appreciated. I would definitely stay again and would recommend. mikemaloney wrote a review Jan 2016\n"

      "50 Fabulous Little Hotel We stayed here for 7 nights over the New Year Period and absolutely LOVED this hotel!    We booked a studio room which was located on the Second Floor and overlooked the street scene. The room was beautifully clean and cleaned every morning whilst we ate breakfast. The staff were very helpful and keen to assist.    There was a choice of 5 breakfast dishes which arrived plated with \"help yourself\" Tea/coffee and juice. The portions were small but this suited us fine.    The location is great in a quiet little street off the beach road. The laundry opposite (leave the hotel, turn right and its the one immediately left) is worth a mention as we used their fast services. The little massage place immediately to the right of the laundry was great too. convey766 wrote a review Jan 2016\n",
      "30 My stay at Nirvana suites Jomtien, Thailand I stayed at this property for three nights from 23 December 2015. The room was good but I think the door of the room needs attention. Service was excellent including wifi. Breakfast was reasonable but unfortunately they did not have an inhouse restaurant.  On the whole it was worth the money we paid for the room. dauntale wrote a review Jan 2016\n",
      "40 Impressive Find I'm impressed. To find such a gem during the high season is truly a stroke of good luck. The hotel is exactly what I was looking for. Tastefully decorated, a moderately soft bed (a rarity for Thai accommodations) , and a kitchenette to boot! The staff is very pleasant and service oriented, breakfast adequate and the price for what you get is unbeatable. A great example of what a nice 3* Thai hotel should be. Worth checking out.

      "40 Great hotel very close to quiet Jomtien Beach Had a relaxed and enjoyable stay here. This is a small hotel that is a very short walk off of Jomtien Beach (the south side so closer to Pattaya Beach).    The rooms are large and clean. Good bed, kitchenette, large fridge with working freezer, flat screen, and balcony. The WIFI was a little sketchy but solved this by buying a SIM card at 7-11 so I had WIFI anywhere in Thailand.    Nice simple breakfast which is part of the room rate (you get a menu to choose a combo from), and all in all very friendly and helpful staff. Room rates are competitive and especially like the decor in the room. Quite a bit of detail and homeliness/apartment like feel to it. The road around the hotel are very local but very safe and are worth a stroll to get a look at local life around the area.  Lots of restaurants within in walking distance and full of 7/11s and Family Marts. Scrambler2 wrote a review Nov 2015\n",

Also all local facilities are nearby. Due to fact that it`s a bit far from road, it`s not too noisy outside, comparing to other hotels of this time in that area. Very friendly staff and tasty breakfast. I`d return to this hotel. Angel S wrote a review Nov 2015\n",

Nice decorated rooms, clean, and so friendly staff. I stayed for 13 night this time, and I loved them all. Only a few minutes to the Beach. Shops, restaurants and bars very near, but still very quiet.  So, is there nothing to complain about? Not realy, but to Balance, here is something: The floor on the bathroom is painful to walk on. And Breakfast was included here so 45 TBH for a small glass of juice? Hmmmm... I just had to say. But I will be back for sure. Terje s wrote a review Oct 2015\n",

      "50 LOVE AT FIRST SITE We arrived at the hotel on 14th Aug 2015 noon by cab from Bangkok and were apprehensive how comfortable it would be when we reached and saw it from outside. It looked very simple and was at the end of a lane in which a number of such hotels were there. But \"WOW\", we fell in love with the interiors the instant we stepped in.  As we found during our stay in Thailand, hardly few locals can speak in English which was the same at this hotel, but their gestures were polite.  We found heaven the moment we entered the room, which could even put to shame a room in any 5 star hotel. No expensive decorations but the person who has decorated it has a class of his own which is very appealing.  Location of the hotel is good as it is on the Jomtien beach which we found more sober than Pattaya beach. Plenty of shops and restaurants exist in the vicinity.  Do go through Agoda.com before you book this place as you may get it at a cheaper rate as I did. Wish you all Happy holidays. 201Pratap wrote a review Sep 2015\n",

Had a problem with the airconditioning on the first day which was fixed within a couple of hours. Breakfast was included in the price, and although limited menu choices perfectly adequate, did not feel hungry at all until well into the afternoon. Situated 150 metres from the beach with pleaty of bars and restaurants in the vacinity. Competetiv prices. David S wrote a review Aug 2015\n",
      "50 Great value for the price, and good customer service For the prices of the hotel, you get quite a bit! They even mailed us a prized stuffed animal to us in Bangkok when it got left behind by our daughter!    The room included a medium size refrigerator, toaster, kitchen sink, two electric stovetop eyes, kitchen cabinets, a small balcony, and a good breakfast.    We booked two rooms side by side. One room for the kids, one for the parents.    Coming from the U.S., we did not expect much for the price, but we were quite pleased. The novelties included the wooden double entry doors, a concrete oversized tub and shower, concrete sink countertop and clean concrete and tiled floors throughout. Lots of Thai charm!

      "50 Pleasant stay as usual My wife and I have stayed here for a couple of nights every year for the last 5 years and it has always been very pleasant. Lovely rooms (huge bed and huge concrete bath!). Simple but nice breakfast that is cooked when you sit down - pleasant change from many other hotels nowadays. Also nicely discounted this year as business must be slack and more competition is opening nearby. Really handy for Jomtien Immigration. And they've upgrade their WiFi now from pretty useless to very good! Its really convenient and good value we think but no doubt there is adequate and cheaper accommodation nearby. Your choice.

      "30 Alright for one night. Had a short one night trip to Pattaya over the long holiday weekend. Despite the long hours of traffic, the stay was accommodating.    We had trouble to locate the hotel in the first place as the entrance is on a smaller soi but the receptionist was a helpful lot when we called. Parking available if you drove to Pattaya from Bangkok.    The room is huge, as we had the suite. Good blend of deco and the bed is comfortable. The only set back is the heat during the day when room is not air condition. Otherwise very close walk to Jomtien beach.    The breakfast is provided, but nothing to shout about. It's a start and you can enjoy plenty food along the street.    Oh, the swimming pool - looks tiny but an option to pool dip if you don't like the beach. :) Jude B wrote a review May 2015\n"

      "50 A Heaven in Jomtien It is a boutique hotel with converted rooms. They have done a great job of keeping the character and adding first-class conveniences. The rooms are very nicely decorated with beautifulThai furniture and artifacts. (could do without the fake tree plants).Spacious and comfortable with kitchenettes and utensils. The industrial size bathtub in our room was pure cement and it looked a bit out of place but added to the ambiance and worked well. We stayed during the New Year's holidays and were able to cook whenever we were tired of going to the restaurants. The locally made wooden king size bed was the most comfortable and the best in functionality and originality. (We are looking to make one for our home!) The hotel is tucked away on a side road and therefore it misses all the noise from Beach Road. Breakfasts are adequate but what makes the place is the front desk staff. They are very kind and show the guests genuine Thai hospitality. When we checked in, the only available suite was on the ground floor but we came to love it. I think the second-floor rooms would be even better. Each suite comes with a little balcony but being on the ground floor we rarely used ours. This hotel gets booked up during the Xmas and New Year's. Although we wanted to stay longer we were able to book only for 4 nights. So advance booking is recommended. As people discover this gem, they come back year after year as we heard some guests comment about staying there before. The staff is also keen to teach you some Thai while you are there specially your room number! We had a fabulous time at this remarkable edifice. gypsysing wrote a review Mar 2015\n",

Bed was large enough to all of us to sleep but it was impossible for service staff to approve that we do not need extra bed. So they brought extra bed in and charged for that. Otherwise everythink was quite ok. Pool was small and we could stay there exept quick nice swim after the beach. Situation is good if you think of Jomtien beach. For us Jomtien itself was dissapointment. There was nothing in neighborhood to do with 12 years old son. JALa67 wrote a review Mar 2015\n",

      "40 Location Location Location My last review of this hotel was based on what I had observed when a friend of mine was staying there (I was in another hotel). This time I booked at Nirvana. What a great location, a few minutes walk and you are at the beach. Plenty of restaurants in the general area as well. While obviously not in the city center of Pattaya (the hotel is in Jomtien) you can be there after a short ride on the Baht Bus. The hotel even offers a taxi service to and from the hotel/airport so check that out as well as their prices are competitive. I recommend this hotel. Friendly staff.  The only thing I would advise is to bring slippers with you, the stone floors are a little hard on the feet. HR Dude wrote a review Nov 2014\n",
      "30 Good for short stay The room is a reasonable size and had a fridge. It was on the second floor. The stairs are quite steep to climb and there is a strange step-up-and-over on each level at the staircase. There is a safe but it is not hidden in a cupboard. The bath is a big chunky monstrosity made of moulded concrete. It is hard to climb over the side for a shower. The room was overlooking Soi 4.    Also, the front door is hard to close properly and I feel not very secure. I think you could open any door to a room by pushing (or pulling) hard on it. Seemed clean enough though and the bed was not too hard. There is a cooked breakfast in the lobby area which you need to order the day before. Triode1000 wrote a review Nov 2014\n",
      "50 A beautiful place. I stay here before and this is the second time. It is far from pattaya walking street so you got to pick a friend that has a motobike. Otherwise they wont come to you. The room is nice size with a kitchen. They do have the electronic thing that suppose to kill biting bugs. Those have been a problem in pattaya. The bars around the area now has really old girls. The staff is very friendly. But always remember to tip. I was a big tipper the last time I was there and they remember me. You get to pick the breakfast you want. Not a buffet breakfast. But there are so many nice place to eat around here. Some restuarant prices are twice the amount of others. So look around before you eat. If you into partying and bar girls and gogo. Best you stay in central pattaya but if you want a nice quiet vacation. This is the place for you. Great for families too. John C wrote a review Nov 2014\n",
      "20 Staff issues I have stayed at the Nirvana Boutique Suites Hotel before. It is a nice hotel, in a good location near Jomtien Beach with access to good places to eat and taxi's to get you to central Pattaya. I was very surprised at the behavior of the House Keeping manager when my wife and I asked for a 2nd sheet for the bed. At 1st they gave us the 2nd sheet and took to blanket. We said we need both as my wife gets cold while I'm still hot. They brought us the blanket and removed the 2nd sheet from the room. We talked with the House Keeping manager and she got very angry and was talking very load to us. We never got a 2nd sheet to go with the blanket. I requested a refund and moved to a new hotel the next day. I had reservations to stay at this hotel again in December, but canceled them. I find it very hard to understand why a hotel would not do what they can to make the customer comfortable. Walter J wrote a review Sep 2014\n",
      "40 The jewel of Jomtien Located in the peaceful area of Jomtien, the hotel is at the end of a small allay. We stayed here for three nights. The beach is walking distance and the area is surrounded with local restaurants and massage parlors. The interior decor gives a true boutique ambiance. We never used the swimming pool as it looked like a pond by the side of the hotel. The breakfast of the hotel was limited as it was not a buffet. They had an a la carte menu and the choices were limited for only 4 dishes, but it was worth for the money we paid. Well, the only negative comment I have is regarding the short haired lady at the reception, may be she has an attitude issue as she was not welcoming at all, never saw a smile and never heard a greeting. Overall, a nice affordable place to stay, and I highly recommend this place for couples seeking a romantic experience in Jomtien. DulshanTilakarathna wrote a review Aug 2014\n",

Cleaning was done every day and very well done..  B/fast ...well... Lets say if you stick to omelet and coffee you will be ok..  B/fast is very very poor offerings..better off not advertising it..

      "50 Absolute little gem of a hotel! I'm surprised about the negative comments, I guess it's a matter of dufferent expectations.    My wife and u have been coming to Jomtien regularly for 3 years, and after fonding this place on our 4th trip or so have stopped even looking for anything else.    Fantastic location, 200 meters from the beach yet tucked away in a quiet side street. The rooms are fantastic, with the beds and huge (!) bathtub key features for us.    Staff have always been courteous and professional throughout our stays, and accomodated all requests. After reading previous reviews about the daytime manager ('little lady with glasses') I paid extra attention this time. Yes, she may smile a bit less than most Thais, but never struck me as rude or unfriendly at all.    The one thing I do agree with is that there is no lift, but a unless you want to stay in a 200+ room monster then you will find the same everywhere around here. We always stay on the first floor and the dozen or so steps are quite manageable. The bell boy carries our suitcases and shopping bags anyway so no issue for us at all.    Compared to previous local hotels in the same price range we found Nirvana Boutique to be a standout and will definitely be back next time. Alex B wrote a review Jun 2014\n",
      "10 Don't bother. Calculative and lousy reception. We are from Singapore and stayed brought our in-laws for a family Chinese New year trip. As we happily lumbered into the hotel we booked on line. It was after a tiring day tour on the first day of the lunar calendar. We are told we need to pay up front 2000+baht more for the extra 3 beds for the three rooms we booked. On short  1) reception sucks. Lady named \"Mam\"(I notice there's lots of references to her in these reviews) is rude and spoke to us rudely. So is another lady who sits in the office next door. She (name unknown) said indignantly,\"Cannot cancel. Need to cancel one week in advance\". Don't get yourself into this sticky situation if you can by opting to pay cash, not online(where possible). Wish I did that and can remove ourselves from this on the first day.  2) no lift. Hotel is four stories high. So good luck if you have elderly parents and get a high floor room.  3) tiny swimming pool.i think it's next to some rubbish dump because when the wind blows in the right direction, you can smell it.  4) calculative. \"Extra bed\">>> charge. (We did not use the beds. Yes yes yes. Kids above five years considered as adult. They really uphold this policy. Very very strictly. Instead, i recommend Aya hotel at Central beach. Its voted top hotel, no wonder. ).\"Did you have a hand towel\">>> Yes we used it at our Taewan island trip and will definitely return. \"Did you keep the laundry bag?\" >>> no it wasn't in our particular room (they confirmed that it wasn't and apologise)    So I won't go back.

Kitcthen is available for long staying guests.  I only wished that they had maintained very high standards of maintenance of their furniture and beddings. They run on limited staff so expect time to be taken for many requests. Breakfast is very limited on size and quantity.

      "50 Close enough for everything but still tucked away This was my third trip to Thailand, previously I'd stayed in Down Town Pattaya, but the decision to move out to Jomtien Beach was definitely a good one. The hotel is nice and clean, but like the previous reviewer I think an extra cup of coffee, tea or orange juice at breakfast would be a nice touch. The pool is small but never seems to get used (only two sun lounges) and is big enough for a refreshing dip. The staff are all pleasant although one of the receptionists can seem rather aloof its just her way and she was fine really. Fresh bedding and towels everyday. Tip when you can (if its only 20 bhatt a time) remember the minimum wage round there is £6 as day so every little helps, same thing goes for the local businesses, a massage across the road costs £6 lasts an hour and is well worth it with or without the \"Happy Ending\" (I'm sure it will cost more with a happy ending if they do one). As said before close to the beach, bars, restaurants and such and transport links (Bhatt Buses and Motorbike taxis) are all available locally. Will be back next February for sure. 4Harry444 wrote a review Mar 2014\n",

The kitchen was a nice touch, though I didn't use it. If I was staying longer, it would have been great (pretty much full kitchen).    Only drawbacks:  Pattaya was having some issues with water (?) and the bathtub didn't work.  There is no elevator, so you're taking the stairs.

There is a cute swimming pool but we didn't try it as the hotel is within easy walking distance of the beach and a longer walk to the water park, worth a visit.

      "50 Perfect and affordable A delayed review but I and my partner travelled here in October 2012. I had been to Thailand many times before and know Pattaya/Jomtien well, this was my partners first trip to Thailand so I was cautious of where we stayed. I had stayed in previous Jomtien hotels how-ever this one caught my eye and thought I would give it a go for its amazing price. Upon arrival the welcoming was perfect not that you can go many places in Thailand and be greeted with rudeness anyway. They provided a welcome drink and were escorted to the room. The room was very large and suited our needs. The only strange thing I suppose is the location of the hotel its rite at the bottom of the soi so if views are what you want this is not for you!    As you are so close to Jomtien sea front (500 metres tops) there are plenty of bahta busses passing so access to Pattaya town is very easy and is a ten minute journey. Please make sure you just jump on and dont arrange a price with the driver you should be paying no more than 10 baht each.    The hotel has a small pool, now by no means is this luxury how-ever when I went it appeared it was only me and my partner that used it and almost felt like a private pool. In all the trip was perfect great location, brilliant staff, access to anywhere in pattaya is possible, breakfast was yummy. Dont hesitate to stay here it really is luxury at an affordable price would stay again ! :)    Ps there is a 7/11 at the end of the soi perfect for snacks and all those little bits you need. The wifi in rooms is also very good and had no problems with it what so ever. Stephen_Goddard wrote a review Oct 2013\n",

Great deal 998 thb per night including breakfast. Arrived and the hotel is tucked away at the end of soi 4 the beach is at the end. There are two blocks, the suites had about 5 guests staying whilst the other block was under refurbishment. There is a lot going on here, large rooms, tiled floor, strange stone effect on the bathroom floor and a huge cleopatra style bath tub made out if stone. The beds were comfortable, small kitchenette area fridge, plasma screen and a number of individual lighting effects. There was a small balcony (I stayed on the ground floor). The rooms were clean, a bit dated and quiet and the reception team were pleasant enough. Coffee is great, I wasn't up early enough to use the breakfast I had paid for. A small private pool area with three loungers and private parking.    So, my verdict was great value, strange place, quiet location, close to the beach, restaurants and bars and I guess with more people staying in the hotel it may have a nice atmosphere.

In fact it is a very average hotel for that price range in Pattaya.The rooms are very big about 42 sq. meter. fully contained but the kitchen only has 2 plates . 2 spoons, 2 bowls so it is a total waste of space to have a kitchen with hot plates etc but that did not bother me as i do not want to cook while travelling in Asia.  My main problem I had with the hotel was the unfriendly staff, lousy breakfast and everything seemed to be a problem.I had thia friends come to the hotel and they were not impressed when they asked could they stay 4 nights and pay 3 as promotation said .Answer was no because they had checked out. The hotel was emply so a little PR would go a long way as these people are wealthy Thais. Yes the management was technically correct but they were asking for an additional room as their business was not complete.  The result of above problem was that they found a room next door for 800 instead of 1550 baht.  Also when you read reviews in guest book also very impressive so not sure what planet some people come from. maybe I am to experienced with Thailand to know what is good standard and what is average. frank wrote a review Jun 2013\n",
      "40 Central Jomtien location, good accommodation, good value Stayed at the Nirvana for one evening while exploring Pattaya with a friend. Booked on his recommendation from previous experience and I was not disappointed for the price at all. I thought the location up a small soi was OK and very central within Jomtien, but it obviously does not leave much opportunity for an outlook/view. The room itself was very good with (virtually) full kitchen facilities, fridge, dining table, huge comfortable bed, a safe and a balcony. The bathroom is nicely styled with a huge bath and good quality shower. The pool is basic and could do with some renovation work on the surrounds, but it would suffice if you were desperate for a swim (sunbathing options are limited so you are better off on the beach I would guess). The breakfast options were fine and we were served quickly on the day we departed, so in all I thought for the rack rate price of 1,550 THB the Nirvana was good value and served its purpose. I've seen other TA reviews in relation to the attitude of reception staff etc etc but did not encounter any such issues. GandCAdventures wrote a review Jun 2013\n",
      "30 Large, apartment-like rooms, but location not so great Stayed here some months ago by chance. It's got a resort-ish feel to it, somewhat like an extra big, red-tiled house with extra large rooms. Note that 'house' means, like any, it's got a used, relaxed feel to it; the rooms are too huge for one person, as its really like an open floor apartment. The large, red floor tiles threw me though, as it was bothersome walking barefoot on the wide gaps in between each tile. The doors, with their native feel (no standard key-card lock here), do not seem secure. The balcony faced the small road along which guests walked a bit to get to the Jomtien beach. One would pass various bars, small restos, pubs along the way, with some market stalls at the end, by the boardwalk. Sound proofing was not so great at night, as happy singing voices from some bars below could carry up into the rooms. LIKES: room service 'authentic' Italian pizza was cheap and delicious, though actually collected from a nearby resto. Free Wifi! discount000 wrote a review Mar 2013\n",
      "10 Bad Bad Bad services This is the worst hotel I ever stayed in during my 35 years for travel. Where did they get the staff? Very unfriendly, rude, bad communication even in basic English, loud mouthed front desk staff and the hotel charges 2,800 baht per night? Breakfast was bad, at this price, I can stay at Siam Bayshore that serves a delicious buffet with over 100 items to choose from. And the service is 100 times better.    Mosquitos and ants in the room, terrible Internet connection, had to ask for soap several time, worst is that loud mouth rude unfriendly day staff has a bad attitude. She is one of those dragon ladies with an attitude.. You can only get 1 beach towel per guest, if you get 2, she will not hesitate to show you her dismay and show you who's boss. She is like and evil step mother and will make you feel that it is going to be my way or the highway, like get the hell out I don't need your business. This all happens AFTER you prepay. When you check in, you have to pay the full amount with no refund if you decide to leave early. We have to carry our own heavy luggage up several flights of stairs since there is no elevator and the bell boy was absent. As such, we are totally at their mercy since we already paid the full amount (2800 x 14 nights) with 3 percent credit card surcharge. What at a terrible 2 week experience at this hotel imagine that you have to deal with her everyday, giving her and getting back the room keys with such an unprofessional and rude behavior. Thailand the land of smile does not exist with this dragon lady. This hotel needs to hire some tourism industry professionals. James P wrote a review Jan 2013\n"

      "10 High Price, Super bad Service !! We had stayed at the Nirvana hotel several years ago and received a great deal, with equally great service. Being a boutique hotel, it WAS a great improvement over the run of the mill hotels, but that has changed....    We came to the Nirvana quite suddenly after having had a security breach at another \"boutique hotel' where we were staying. We requested a room for 2 weeks and, because we were staying for an extended period of time, we asked for a discount. The manager and her assistant declined to give us any consideration for our urgent situation. The room rate was fixed and was to be paid in full upon check-in with NO REFUNDS what so ever...even for emergencies. We should have left right then and there as things went downhill within the next few days.    First of all, inadequate security became an issue. After checking in the room, we found that the balcony doors do not lock properly and could be opened easily. There are safes in the room but they may not accommodate laptops. The balcony doors had to be secured with strategically  placed rocks to jam the doors shut. Laptops had to be locked in our suitcases.    Secondly, the hotel provides towels for guests to use for their small pool, but everyone takes them to the beach after signing for them. The towels are older, with frayed edges, certainly not something that would be used in the guest rooms. We took four towels as to adequately cover the lounges at the beach. When we returned from the beach, we were chastised by the day staff at the front desk for taking more towels than we were allowed...1 towel per person two towels per room max.    My friend felt that there was no logic to the \"boutique\" hotel's two towel policy and felt that he should discuss his request for 2 towel per guest. After listening to him for 20 seconds, she blew him off, claiming not to understand english, and immediately called the manager to the front desk. The manager listened to my friend and then reiterated the hotel policy of 2 towels per room. He again asked her to listen to his explanation, she then stated that they didn't have enough towels for all the guests to use at the beach. He stated that this was a beachside \"boutique\" hotel and maybe they should purchase some more towels to adequately fill the needs of the guests.. She then stated that the laundry wasn't able to pick up, launder, and return enough towels within a day.. The excuses kept coming..with no resolution of the issue..... The manager and the front desk assistant, then, made sure that an insufficient number of beach towels were left out each morning. I don't think the staff should get into an heated open ended discussion over a simple request of 1 additional towel for the beach lounge bed. We were required to \"ask\" for 2 towels every morning for 12 days.    Things became extremely impersonal from that moment on. We were never acknowledged and heavily ignored by any day staff members other than the bellboy. No one would even look at us for the remaining time there. We also noticed that the day time staff do not really communicate with any of the hotel guests. And remember \"NO REFUNDS\" \"NO EXCEPTIONS\". The vacation became increasingly uncomfortable each day when we had to give the key to the front desk woman.. she would grab it and not utter a word. The overall stay at this hotel was very unpleasant. A personal vendetta from the day staff over two frayed, old towels that should have been tossed in the trash.    A high priced \"boutique\" hotel should provide personal, individual, and attentive service to its guests. If it cannot or will not, it should remove the \"boutique\" name. Staff at a \"boutique\" hotel should understand what the word implies. They should especially understand that their paying guests deserve more individual consideration and behave in a business like manner, regardless of what their personal feelings are.    I do not recommend this hotel simply because of the high price (we paid about US$93 per night) with lack of service. Breakfast was inadequate, coffee terrible, internet is inconsistent, and worst of all very unfriendly staff. The day staff is uneducated, spoke broken english that was very difficult to understand, unprofessional, loud and vulgar. At this price, there are much better hotel choices around Pattaya and Jomtien beach area. I would definitely stay away from Nirvana Boutique Hotel. Jeff R wrote a review Jan 2013\n",
      "40 Great rooms, but... Stayed in a studio, a 40 sqm large room that even got a kitchen, -but no cooking utilities at all, have a kitchen for what?  The bathroom got a very large bathtub, good for 2, and the bed and bed linen is one of the best I slept in, and the room is very well cleaned.  The breakfast is ok, but poor for a boutique hotel.  The pool area can only be reach from the street and the pool is small and wooden deck feels not safe.  The front desk staff was correct but not very friendly and charging 3% when you pay by credit card, for a full paid room not booked over an agent, thats cheep !  We also tried to book a van back to airport, the answer was, can not, and for a taxi they wanted 200 more then booked on the street! kenthagent wrote a review Nov 2012\n",
      "30 Some things are missing Our room was large and nicely decorated. Service was friendly and location good with only 100 meters to the beach. Still, some details didn't meet my expectations given that this is a fairly pricey place. The pool is minimal and there's no real pool area. Also breakfast was mediocre. A small issue when on the top floor is the lack of an elevator. Magnus wrote a review Nov 2012\n",
      "30 Boutique at first glance only Boutique implies something special or different, a term which when advertised by a hotel may attract a customer who thinks they will be receiving a service that is not routine or bland. This hotel claims to be super deluxe in features and to serve you best however I disagree.  At first appearance the room did seem deluxe as the area was large, clean and spacious with attractive decor and artwork. There was a very large kitchen area however the cupboards were bare, and devoid of any form of cookware except a toaster and kettle. There was a cooktop but no pots or pans. There was nothing to wipe the sink down with or dry your hands with. There was a bowel, plate and a cup and saucer per customer with cutlery to match. The flooring was attractive, but uncomfortable to walk on in bare feet as the tiles were widely spaced and the grout deeply recessed. There was no lock or even latch on the balcony door and there was no tinting on the windows. The doors merely closed and there was no privacy from the buildings across the road unless the blockout curtains were drawn. The main double entry door did not inspire security confidence as the bottom bolt did not protrude deeply enough into the concrete floor, and a firm shove with a shoulder would easily give room entry.  The bed was very comfortable, however getting in and out of it required planning in order to avoid hitting the 40cm plus wooden ledge that the mattress sat on as our bruised shins attested to. The bathroom design would be more suited to an outside pool area as it had a heavily pebbled floor that would be hard to clean without a thorough hose down. The floor was also quite painful to walk on without shoes. The ridiculously huge concrete bath looked more like an outdoor trough. It was anything but inviting or romantic and would be difficult to comfortably fill or clean. Ironically the hotel had a sign in the bathroom asking customers to use water frugally.  The hotel provided electrical mosquito repellent devices which were necessary as mosquitoes were able to enter through the balcony doors when open and between the spaces in the entry doors. Wifi was sporadic and there were mattresses stored against the wall in the corridor.  Not recommended for the asking money. sapote wrote a review Oct 2012\n",

      "40 Good value Room nice, large, clean and well equipped, including kitchen area. Comfortable bed. Location OK for Jomtien and ideal if you are not looking for the infamous Pattaya night life. Not far from beach but no sea view rooms really unless you bend out of your balcony to catch a glimpse of the sea. No elevator but a maximum of 3 floors up should be OK for anyone who is not handicapped. Breakfast basic, just OK. Have not used pool and also not Restaurant for other than breakfast so cannot comment on these. As far as rooms are concerned I would say you get a 4 star room for a 3 star price. We stayed in one 2 bedroom suite and one 1 bedroom suite with our extended family. Fiftycountriesplus wrote a review May 2012\n"

      "40 Great find in Jomtien Beach First off I should state that I did not personally stay here, my friend and travelling companion found this nice boutique hotel on his own and he stayed there. My observations are as a visitor not as a guest.    Having said that I think the hotel was quiet good. The rooms are big and well laid out. The bed looked very comfortable. The staff are extremely friendly and even started teaching my friend some basic Thai words. Nice touch.    The location is good because you are off the main road but not too far so that walking to the actual beach is easy. HR Dude wrote a review May 2012\n",
      "30 It's okay This is a perfectly good hotel. It's got an attractive decor, the staff are fine and it's not expensive. Beware if you need to use your car. It's a real tight squeeze and you can get into disputes with buses. If you just wanna walk to the beach and bronze it's ideal. brimpsfield wrote a review Feb 2012\n",
      "30 Gorgeous Hideaway Look Nirvana is not one one of the prettiest Soi's in Jomtien, but it is such a nice nice place to stay. The rooms are very nicely done in Thai furnishing and they offer standard rooms deluxe 1 bedroom and a 2-bedroom which we have used many times. And the rates are very reasonable for Pattaya. Jomtien Beach is a great location for families as its friendly and cheap, just dont expect Phuket like blue water, this is a Bangkok weekend getaway area in addition to the thousands of international tourists. But thats why we like it - and, you have all the Pattaya nightlife only 10 minutes by very frequent baht bus for only 10 baht per person. The pool at Nirvana is neat for an afternoon dip after the beach but its not a resort so dont expect resort style pool! The only issue is NO LIFT, not a problem if you are reasonably fit but it would be ground floor if you dont like stairs....    The breakfast is OK but like a lot of Thai hotels, fairly basic - but again, it is quite ok.    Water pressure in the whole area is light, so dont expect raging showers.    Soi 4 is quiet and peaceful, full of thai/falang guesthouses and is definitely not glamorous.    If you are solo and after raging nightlife, stay in central Pattaya. But if you want a mix of beachside ambience and the choice of relaxing evenings or hardcore partying, Jomtien is a good spot..... ColinX100 wrote a review Jan 2012\n",
      "30 Nice hotel, near a not so clean beach 1. after arriving at the room we were awed by the thai decoration, so we completely forgot how small the pool was (which remained in the shade for most of afternoon, hence, cold)  2. the one bedroom apartment has a living room, a dining table, a small kitchen, and a good-sized, clean, well-air-conditioned, and quiet bedroom... the water pressure of the hotel is low, so forget about using their huge cement tub  3. we had stayed on the top floor, but it faces other apartments, so not much of a view  4. but view did not matter, as the beach is just 5 minutes stroll away (P.S. stick to main road, because we wandered into an alley between Nirvana Couture and Nirvana Boutique, and bumped into a bar FULL of drag queens yelling at us)  5.no lift, their food is ok, but do NOT order massage INTO your room, they kept implying EXTRA service... if you want it, get it at the massage parlor downstairs  6. jomtian beach is slightly cleaner than pattaya, but as pattaya, the water is not clear, and the sand strip is fully populated with chairs for rental. however, its a delight to eat on the beach, as vendors walk around all the time  7. downtown pattaya is just 10-20 Baht/person ride away on the taxi-trucks(songtiaew), its easier to get this rate if you flag down the taxi that is already carrying someone Ed1982_10 wrote a review Dec 2011\n",
      "10 WATCH OUT! I booked this roomed thru the internet. First let me say I arrived early and they did put me put. The best part of my stay. Next the pool is just a splash pool and is dirty most of the time. I was moved thee times during my stay of 8 days and then left early. They state you can get a refund up to 70% but this will not happen. The sheets had holes in them and patches as I will post pictures. The floor is the worst in the bathroom as it has peebles, that rise up and are very hard on the feet. I had ants the entire time in the bathroom. The pictures look nice but they were taken when it was new! Remember that becuase they look nice on the net. The kitchen has NO pots or pans if you want to try and cook ony plates, bowls and knife and fork. The worse part is every room the patio doors have at least one that will not lock so they can get in your room without breaking in a door. I found this to be very uneasy and if I were a women or couple I would be worried. The staff are nice but that is the best part of the hotel. Internet works the best on the outside on your patio. Your sheets are washed every 2-3 days unless you demand them too. In this city for the money you can find some very nice hotels for the price and cheaper. I did later. I would stay clear of this hotel at all costs and look at it before I booked it if you must. Your paying way to much for rooms that have cracks in the floor tiles that can cut your feet etc and their are so many more nicer ones for the price. They charge for every liite thing so again be warned on this hotel. sorry the pictures are not better but you can see anyway. Remember that every room is missing one lock so anyone can climb into thru the padio door. voodoothatido4u wrote a review Apr 2011\n",

Lounge area & bedroom both had small balconies. TV could be swung around from loungeroom to bedroom. Decor just perfect. Staff all very friendly & welcoming. Breakfast we ate each morning outside on the footpath. The Nirvana is down the very end of soi 4 not a busy soi. Lots of laundry places across from the Nirvana. Restaurants close by & many bars.  Beach area the chairs & umbrellas are packed in & you have to sit where they tell you.lol.  We spent 2 afternoons sitting front row,talking to other travellers. Shopping was cheap & we did a trip to Pattaya one day which was good for shopping. Walked heaps around Jomtien the beach road is very long. Stopped & watched two Thai Highschools play a game of football. School bands & all. chuckyJellie wrote a review Jan 2011\n",
      "40 Nirvana was a good experience for me. I liked the Nirvana Boutique Suites Hotel. As previous posters have noted, it is on one of the sois near Jomtien Beach - located about 100m deep into the soi. The soi is a collection of guesthouses, shops, and restaurants - I had no problem with noise when in the hotel.    I was quite impressed with the decor of the room. Very comfortable bed (although there is a sort of ledge around the outside of the mattress that you will undoubtedly crash into at some point during your stay, hurting your leg). Plenty of pillows. My room was on the 4th floor (using the American standard where the ground floor is the first floor) and it required walking up the three flights of stairs. I booked a \"deluxe\" room and wound up with a separate bedroom and living area (with sofa and television).    The bathroom had a very large stone bath - quite a nice experience for lounging. The floors of the whole place are a very nice Mediterranean style tile. In the bathroom, this is complemented by a pebble-stone flooring that is uncomfortable if you step off the smooth tiles. My room had a very large balcony from which you can check out the action on the soi (and see the water if you look hard enough).    I had no problem with check-in, and all went well when leaving. The front desk staff were very helpful and courteous. Very important to me - there was free wireless internet and it worked well during my stay. The television stations were OK - many international stations but the English-language option seemed to focus on action movies.    In general, I was pleased here. I found the price to be reasonable, and the hotel was in a very nice class for the Jomtien area. bobby_l wrote a review Jan 2011\n"

      "40 great hotel but lousy reception person I have to say that the Hotel is ideal for most people, the rooms are very well maintained and only lacking a microwave and a DVD player which you can rent for 100 baht a day, But i do think that the room would be better if both items where supplied free of charge.  The double bed and pillows where high quality and i always had a good nights sleep, All the Cups and plates are of high quality to and you don't need to pay a deposit for breakages.  Not to sure on the bathroom, but that accounts to taste  The staircase leading up to the rooms can be very hard work in the high humidity of September, but no room for a lift.  Breakfast was good but maybe a little orange juice would be welcome.  swimming pool was smaller than i thought it would have been , but with the beach only 2 minutes walk away, then maybe the beach is the better option.    my only fault with the hotel was a vey lousy reception person who we had met on all 4 days of our visit and she knew both myself and my girlfriend. On the 5th night, we returned to the hotel at 11pm only for the receptionist to ask my GF for her ID card making her out to be either a prostitute or someone who i had picked up from a bar, my girlfriend explained that the hotel had her passport details and i could see that my GF was very upset, But we decided to let the matter drop.  The following night, my girlfriend went back to the hotel on her own while i picked up a few things from a local shop, when i got to the room , My GF was in tears and i asked her why, The same Receptionist refused to give her the key for the hotel room more or less saying that she was trying to gain access to a hotel room without permission, My GF explained that she was on holiday with me and that the hotel had all our details from the time off booking.  I followed this up by speaking to the Receptionist and she told me that she was sorry.  the next day i made a formal complaint to the management and explained everything to them and with a response saying that they would speak to the lady in question,  if the Receptionist had bothered to check our file, she would have found photo copy's of our passport's  All this caused my GF 2 days of upset and tears Plus humiliated and offended in front of the night watchman, Plus it didn't show me in a good light either.  it would have been nice if the hotel had followed up our complaint with a bunch of flowers for my GF or some spa treatment as a sorry from the hotel.    can i also had that i have been dating my GF for 3 years now and she has been to the UK and we have also toured quite a lot of Asia together and this is the first time that my GF has been asked for ID since i always book for both of us.    all that aside, I would still use the hotel again. 9 out of 10 malct wrote a review Oct 2010\n",

      "50 Affordable luxury My last couple of trips (in the slow season) The Diamond Beach Hotel where I have stayed for years off of Walking Street kept raising their rates and didn't seem to appreciate their customer loyalty. I always wondered what it would be like to stay in more peaceful Jomtien. I chose this hotel based on a recommendation from a friend. I thought I would spend a few nights here and move into Pattaya but I was pleasantly pleased with staying in Jomtien, and very comfortable in this hotel, and spent my whole ten days here. Staff was friendly. The hotel is located down a quiet street and has good motorcycle parking and easy enough to get to Pattaya and other locations in Jomtien. It is a convenient walk to the beach. There is night life on the adjacent streets on a much slower pace than Pattaya. I can also recommend Surf Kitchen walking distance along beach road and to the left. Good sushi and Thai food at an affordable price.    I stayed in the junior suite which was plenty spacious for me. The wifi in the rooms was fast, ac cold and plenty of channels on the flat screen tvs. The hotel was a little quiet for this time of year and I was offered a free upgrade to a bigger room but declined. It was nice of them to offer.    I ate out most of the time, but did take advantage of a late breakfast a couple of times, and heated up some leftovers in the kitchen a couple of times. Despite my few late wake ups the maids still were able to service my room. JimCA2 wrote a review Sep 2010\n",

No seaview cos it's 50 meters from the beach which is good for us cos it's quiet. Only 3,400 Baht/night for 4 people. Hotel staff said they could accept 5-6 people without extra cost and I agree cos we have too much space :-D There is a lovely small pool in the hotel wit shower. U can get beach / pool towels at front desk. Just need to sign your name and time. Breakfast is like an American or Thai breakfast set. They said it's open until 10am but we came after 10am but they still allowed us to get free breakfast wit friendly smile. Staff here are helpful. U don't need to stay at 5 star hotel but u can get pretty clean room wit beautiful decoration and good services. They allowed us to leave our baggage at the front counter after we check out at noon.

      "10 This was the most dirty hotel I ever been We booked Apartment in this hotel after reading rewievs here.  The first room we stayed had broken entrance door and there was no possibility lock them, so next day we moved to another. The room was quiet big and nice furnished in Thai style, but decor quality wasn’t good. Lot of furniture were damage and no one cares about it. The kitchen-units wasn’t necessary because there wasn’t any pot. We stayed on 4th floor and the room was very loud, behind thin wall there were water boilers with pumps working whole nights.  Breakfast was very poor: every day only eggs an slice of beacon, no juice, no water only coffee or tea. Staff were very bored and unhelpful. Problem was with the wi-fi internet. For 3 days it worked only few hours, after they reset net. I needed good internet access to work.  And the worst thing – cleanness. Towels were never changed, even we left it on a floor. Our room was never cleaned well, the floor was really dirty, mould in the bathroom.  Every morning we woke up with about 10-15 bites all over arms back and legs. Very itchy! At first I thought there was a mosquito in the room but then discovered bugs in a bed. We reviewed the bed and found dirty underwear behind mattress (how they changed bad linen!).  Ended up after 3 days we checked out, for this price there were good 4 stars hotels (we paid 2 400THB/nigth). We moved to new Best Western with beautiful view over bay and paid a lot less.

The location is good and convinient with plenty 7-elevens and eating places just outside the soi. There is a good tour agent exactly outside the junction, good , friendly, speak decent english, punctual and reliable too. The beach in front is also nice with plenty water sports activities.

      "40 Nirvana Suites I like this hotel, overall staff are very good. The rooms are always nice, although this time round the shower curtains in the two rooms I stayed in were covered in black mould - the maids need to pay attention to cleaning these, just disgusting - I asked front desk staff to have them cleaned but nothing happened. I bought my own bleach and did it myself! Checkin at 10pm was a nightmare firstly because Agoda failed to do what they promised and that was fax through the confirmation (I had to call Agoda from the hotel to have that sorted out) so the hotel had no idea I was arriving and told me they didnt have any rooms available for the period I booked and paid. Secondly the young lady on the desk was not interested at all and she would not have cared if I had not pushed the issue with her and went off to find another hotel. I found her to be surly and unpleasant throughout my stay. All other staff were very good and very helpful. Checkin took nearly an hour whilst she fittered around and talked on the phone. I have stayed here before but never used room service, this time I ordered. Food was all cold, not sure if they cook fresh in the hotel or order in from somewhere else, but all dishes were cold. No microwave in the room to re-heat. This is a good hotel and certainly value for money for the high class first rate rooms and the location. I will stay here again but checkin earlier in the day when the good staff are working. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Jan 2010\n",
      "50 a great hotel to stay overall, it was great! I would rank it 8 marks out of 10. The room was nice, clean, pretty culture.... people are nice!! 2 mins walk to the beach, there were many restaurant and entertainment around the hotel. Everything was just so convenient...

      "30 Nirvana Boutique Suite Hotel This hotel is in a great location and you will genuinely be pleased with the size and the facilities within the room. Nice bed, smart kitchen area, flat screen TV, modern bathroom. Have always been happy with this place in the past. But they seem to be letting the hotel downturn (the hotel is right at the Jomtien beach and yet pretty empty) affect their maintenance. The bathroom taps and fittings are coming loose / breaking. No attempt to fix them. The rooms are getting a bit jaded.    I always liked this place, but will not be rushing back. Time to spend an extra baht and go to a four star!

      "20 Nirvana Couture Just O.K. We had previously stayed at the original Nirvana Hotel when it first opened. The suites there were fine, but the climb to our floor was inconvenient. Thought we would try the new Nirvana Couture, one building from the original hotel. This time we included breakfast which was much the sameness every day.  Room was o.k., showing signs of wear, but shower was not. The same as Jomtien Beach which has gone downhill since our last visit when there were many Scandinavians staying in the area.  They seem to be going elsewhere. The clientele in the area seemed less prosperous and less well travelled than on our previous visits. This will be our last trip to Jomtien Beach, I fear. It has become too much like Pattaya in many ways. A shame! A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Dec 2009\n",
      "40 Nirvana Boutiique Pattaya Overall my stay at the Nirvana Boutiuqe Hotel was very comfortable and the staff were very welcoming. The rooms are pleasent and tastefully furnished, with a good standard of house keeping. The television reception could somtimes be weak but the Internet signal was always strong and efective. The location of the hotel is good with many watering holes near by and lots of good restaurants. The beach is only a stones through away which is always convienient. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Dec 2009\n",
      "40 Exciting stay at value price! The sink in the bath cannot work properly. As the room is very big, the air-conditioner can hardly supply coolness for the whole room. Cheap and local food restaurants are around as well as laundry and beach. Will surely stay here again if there will be another trip to Pattaya. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Dec 2009\n",
      "20 Small hotel 500 meters from the beach The staff in this hotel realy need to be given a service course. My family didn`t feel welcome from the first minut. After 3 nigts we changed hotel. The hotel has not an elevator, If you get a room in 3 floor and have small children you will get a hard time. We had to change room and the shower did not work properly in any rooms. The room was dirty and the breafast was realy poor. They serve you one slide of ham, one small sausage, one egg and one toasted bread. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Dec 2009\n",
      "40 Nirvana couture hotel Nicely refurbished hotel. Great size room with comfy bed. We stayed here for two nights. Close to beach and beachside restaurants. Only problem was that we couldn't coonnect to the wi-fi network and staff were unable to solve the problem. It's a great hotel as long as you are not relying on the free Wi-fi!!

      "40 Nirvana Couture Rooms Hotel I stayed at the Nirvana Couture twice over a period of 16 days. On the first visit I arrived late in the evening and I was impressed by the receptionist's politeness in spite of the late hour. The room was better than I expected with the exception of the shower. The shower was open plan which means that the whole bathroom got wet during a shower but that was a small thing considering that it quickly dried.    The room was cleaned every day and the cleaning staff were both polite and helpful.    The hotel is situated in Soi 4 Jomtien just off Beach Road. There is an excellent cafe 2 doors away. The night life goes on until 2AM and Walking Street is but a few miles away. There is transport 24/7 to take you anywhere you want to go.    I will certainly use this hotel again.

      "30 Nirvana relaxation Nirvana at Jomtien is a nice place to stay if you want to be close to the beach and away from the frantic and seedy Pattaya. Although you are only a short bhat bus (10min) ride away from all the nitelife and shopping the area has to offer. The hotel rooms are modern and comfortable with lots of room. The tiles on the floor are a little hard to walk on, and the bed corners can be hazardous if the light isn't on. The staff performance wasn't consistent and English was limited. There are better eating options away from the hotel.  Many Russian tourists seem to enjoy taking their family with kids on an evening stroll down Walking street. I don't understand why.  For single guys, Pattaya is as good as it gets. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Nov 2009\n"

      "40 A rare gem hidging behind the beach I was dropped off by a truck filled with people(Pattaya’s taxi) on the entrance of a small street of soi 4 at Jomtien beach road. The small street looked unimpressive with hawkers and cheap restaurants clustering the already narrow passage way that was paved with uneven cement floor leading to the hotel. As one walked along the path one could see a row of cheap guest houses. I was thinking what on earth have I booked for accommodation, and I am not the type that will rough it out as a bag packer. Half hearted with disappointment I continued to venture inner into the street which was more of an alley. Finally, I saw the hotel which was an unimpressive 3 story building of concrete and tiles. However, upon entering through the door was a rather cozy lobby that greeted me and somewhat brighten my mood a little. Friendly receptionist spoke simple but passable English, checked me in and in no time I was ushered up 3 levels on foot to my studio room. The room was big with a tile kitchenette and dinning set arranged with cutlery. I was presently surprised to see that the bed was king sized and covered by quality linen. More then meets the eyes was the goose feathers filled mattress and pillows – one of the most comfortable kinds, and one only find them at top end hotels with their suite rooms. The bath room was equally cozy with designer pebbles flooring, a proper vanity mirror and table, but the best was the huge, two men sized and rustic looking bath tub! I thought I could drown myself to death that night from taking a bath. The room was also beautifully adorned with Thai artifacts of cottage and ethnic style and with a sizable walk in wardrobe good enough for a fashion queen! I was breath taken by the surprise I got from such value for money, that I need to go to the balcony to get some fresh air!    This hotel truly shows that one should never judge a book by its cover!    It was a rare gem among stones, I was very happy with the find.    Oh yes!

Normally, the low cost places that I stay at are nowhere near as nice. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Jul 2009\n",
      "40 Great Place When my wife I were dating we went to Thailand. Upon arrival to Nirvana we thought it would be just another hotel near the beach. To our surprise we discovered that it was more like a studio apartment in that you could cook, and there was a pretty nice sized fridge.  The room was big and the bathroom was very nice. If there one thing I did not like, it was the size of the pool, but then it seemed that we were the only one using it the few times that we did, which made it fine.  The location is right in the middle of Jomtien, which has some of the most beautiful beaches in Pattaya. Though it is not on the beach, it is less than a minute's walk to the beach from the front door of the hotel.  Overall, it was a great experience for us and we would recommended it to anyone going to Pattaya or Jomtien. TheoTravels wrote a review Jul 2009\n",
      "40 Clean and Comfortable Clean and Spacious. We love the decoration and very heart warming when we first enter the hotel. It gives a safe and comfortable feeling.

      "40 Impressive Hotel in the Heart of Jomtien This hotel was a pleasant surprise. It is in Soi 4 on Jomtien beach, which means it is within easy walking distance of the heart of Jometien. The Soi is busy, but we were on the third floor and found that it was a quiet, peqaceful room.    The rooms are done out to an excellent standard, far beyond what you would expect for the price. The bathroom was very nice (though take your own toiletries).    TV is good with over 20 channels available, including many English language and movie channels.    The hotel is very pleasant and the staff smiling and helpful.    The beach is about 100 metres from the hotel, with lots of bars, cafes, convienence stores and street vendors around as well as the usual selection of host bars and massage venues (though minimal compared to the Pattaya nightmare).    There is little to fault this hotel for. It is definitely excellent value for money and in a good location within Jomtien.    Breakfast is basic, but edible!

The airconditioner worked great and kept us cool. The TV was a nice flat screen and had many options. Over all a very good deal with the exception being the pool. It was kind of odd that you had to drop off your keys when coming and going, but that was not a big deal. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Jun 2009\n",

The bathroom has a large bath but an uncomfortable pebble floor. The beds are large but low and the protruding wooden edge is ideally situated to wrap your shins off .. something my mate did on more than 1 occasion. The breakfast is excellent. There is a safety deposit box in the rooms. Unfortunately one of the hotel rooms was broken into when we were there and the police called.

      "30 Nice Hotel...Poor Management We feel The Nirvana Boutique Suite Hotel has potential but poor management left a bad taste in our mouths. Firstly, we weren’t even sure if we had arrived at the right location because (a) there are two buildings built in different styles that say Nirvana and (b) there isn’t a sign anywhere that says Boutique Suite Hotel. When I walked in and asked (politely) if this was the Nirvana Boutique Suite Hotel, I got a, “Yeah,” and a look from the receptionist like I was an idiot. They really should fix their signs or re-think the name they submit to websites such as Agoda.com. At the very least they should be empathetic enough to realize that people new to the area might be a bit confused, especially when there are two buildings in different styles.    The suite itself was small and clean. There wasn’t a window or balcony but that didn’t bother us. The room had great lighting, including dimmer switch for setting the mood, and blue string lights. The flat screen TV mounted on the wall was a nice touch. The bed was really comfortable. The washroom was clean, but it had an “open” shower that would soak the entire room. They do not provide any soap, shampoo, or anything like that, which I found strange for a hotel that was attempting to be more upscale. When I went downstairs the receptionist wasn’t to be found so, about 10 minutes later, the security guard/doorman ran down to the convenience store and bought us some. He was hardest working guy in the place!    I’m not usually one to complain about hotel breakfasts because I travel a lot and they’re all sort of the same. However, this is the only establishment I went to where the complementary breakfast was only good for an American breakfast. That’s it. No choice at all. And you’d better be happy with one cup of coffee because nobody’s offering more. I got the feeling that the hotel was only including breakfast to keep up with the other hotels that offer it as a perk. Too bad their lack of commitment to quality really shows.

      "50 A place that welcomes you home Though our flight was early in the morning the hotel was very accommodating making sure we were comfortable waiting for our room to get ready as they were fully booked. Once going to the room we found the the sweet Thai/ English European experience walking up the stairs, no elevator to my knowledge. Don't care. Once to the room the double wooden doors welcome you into a large spacious room with kitchenette, table and 2 chairs, bed and chair. Nice balcony to the street that some say is loud, for me not so. The restaurant in the lobby area is rather large and yet cozy with flat screen tv and bar. Overall and very good experience and would recommend to everyone.

      "30 There are a lot better Hotels for the price We booked the Hotel based on the reviews here, which is always fraught with danger of course as we all have different expectations.    Overall is was OK. But only OK. The first room we were offered was on the ground floor facing the street, it was musty, the curtain rails had come off and were lying on the floor. Needless to say we asked for another room.    We ended up on the third floor which was OK. Room size was good, but the quality of the fittings/decor was not that great. The bath was the biggest I have ever seen, and was cast out of bare concrete. Could have put 4 of in it. Beds were Thai style and hard as a rock.    The first night we had a karaoke party going on in the Soi. There are lots of bars a few doors along. This went on till 1:30am, at which time we finally got to sleep. We asked the security man to try to close our balacony doors to block out the noise, but they were so badly fitted, they could not be closed properly.    The staff were pleasant enough, but it was the little things that let them down. Like every time at breafast, the table clothes were soiled from the previous guests. The dining area was rather like a Truck Drivers cafe.    Because we like Jomtien, we checked out a few other Hotels in the same price range. In future I would try Jomtien Garden, or Dragon Resort. These also have the benefit of being right on the beach road (not right on as it would be noisy, but set back in Hotel garden etc) so 50m walk to beach, and both have decent sized pools. The Nirvana pool is about 5 metres long and hidden in a fenced off corner at the back of the building.    So not a disaster, but there is a lot better for the price (we paid about Baht 1,500 via internet). roboSydney wrote a review Jan 2009\n",

      "50 Get Retro at Nirvana Boutique We have been staying here every month for about a year. The staff are very polite and efficient. The street is quiet, yet you are close to very happening bars on just 4 streets over in each direction. Food in restaurants on the street is cheap and good. Lots of foreigners.

      "30 Overall, this hotel is very nice. It's very nice hotel, clean, new and close to North/South Pattaya. I really love breakfast there , it's not such a general breakfast which come with ham, cold sausage and white bread. Here serve with fine bacon and sausage, and bread is very crispy I LOVE English Breakfast Here....I will go back for sure, but this time will try Lanna Room A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Jan 2009\n",
      "50 Home away from home Nirvana Boutique Suites is an extremely friendly place with the strongest and most reliable wifi signal in the Jomtien/Pattaya area. I found that the owners and staff will go out of their way to make you feel at home. The rooms are spacious (approximately 45 m2) with built-in kitchen units. In my opinion, the Jomtien area is a lot more laid-back and friendly when compare to the hustle and bustle of Pattaya proper. The beach (approximately 80m down the road from the hotel) is certainly cleaner and wider.    Food is reasonably priced and tasty. I have not had any stomach upsets during my 4 weeks´ stay, so i would think that hygiëne standards are up to scratch. A full frie-up breakkie is included in the room charge.    The pool is a bit small, but adequate for a splash. Don´t expect an olympic size monster ! raoul-private wrote a review Jan 2009\n",
      "30 new years special The hotel was ok... not horrible... my room was clean and the staff was super nice... but I feel that I did pay too much for the room that I got. I was a bit upset about the shower and had to stay at the top of the steps..... I did manage to find a more reasonable, quieter hotel, with a shower, just down the beach. I do recommend the going further down the beach for the quieter hotel maybe about 1/2 miles..... A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Jan 2009\n",
      "50 came as guest go as friend came here last april for the first time and was more than impressed by the large tastefully decorated rooms in all catagories.So coming back to finalize home purchase there was only one place I wanted to stay...nirvana boutique....from the breakfast in bed...(well if you take it across yourself) to the sincere good night sir ,nothing can be faulted. Not only the owner, Nathan, who takes time to chat and the general manager Adam ,who might even give you a lift on his motorbike, but all the staff treat you as someone special. I have rarely stayed in such a relaxing hotel. gay friendly straight friendly, just a great bunch to be around. negatives...great tasting breakfast but gets a little boring after a few days..what about some variation?  Other than that I feel quite sad having my own home now in Pattaya...but i am sure that I will see the crew again...  Thank for everything ....A gay friendly hotel with only pleasant memories! maggiebalu wrote a review Dec 2008\n",
      "50 a perfect wedding After the dream wedding we had in there resort \"Nirvana Koh Chang\", we decided to stop off for a couple of nights at there other hotel \"Nirvana Boutique Suites\" on our way back to Bangkok. There was a lot to live up to, following the fantastic service we received at the resort, however they did! On arrival, we were greeted with a beautiful bunch of flowers, and a glass of champagne, this also included a free room upgrade to the huge 1 bedroom deluxe apartment. For breakfast, instead of the usual bland buffet we have come so used to seeing, we had freshly made poached eggs, Linconsire sausages and fresh coffee, which my husband really loved! All in all, it was a perfect end to a wedding! We will be back. apinporn wrote a review Nov 2008\n",
      "50 Cool and comfortable Having been so happy with Nirvana resort in Koh Chang I thought I would try the Boutique hotel run by the same company. Pleased to say the beds were awesome and the furniture was cool and comfortable. Same helpful staff. Nothing too much trouble and the food was great and cheap! So nice to find a quality place. Have stayed in Pattaya alot but this is the first time my surroundings have felt so luxurious especially for the money. Not sure how they do it! Dollydawson wrote a review Aug 2008\n"

      "50 A boutique hotel in the true sence of the word Following a recent trip to thaland at the Nirvana Spa & Resort, I was so happy with my stay that I decided to go back but this time, whilste remaining in the same group, I went to Pattaya and stayed at the Nirvana Boutique Suites.    I have seen bigger and better hotels but here I found the attention to details second to none.    During my stay a couple had their wedding organized by the hotel and were overwelemed by the service... travelingworker wrote a review Aug 2008\n",
      "50 The jewel of Jomtien! The word \"BOUTIQUE\" really does get miss used through out Asia, But it doesn't for Nirvana Boutique Suites! Our studio room was large with all the amenities required. Although there was no lift, there is only 4 floors, including the ground floor. Our room was beautifully decorated and included a dining table and chairs,on checkout we booked for our next trip in December, and cant wait to go back!! Thank you Nirvana ChanYanYu wrote a review Jul 2008\n",
      "50 Simply Nirvana.. A hotel nicely located in the Jomtien area of pattaya, and its only situated only a minutes walk from the beach.    The hotel is beautifully decorated with a boutique decoration of old/new Thai artefacts which give it a nice local feel. The room i'm staying in is huge for a Studio, it has it own kitchenette, dining area, very comfortable beds, and all the usual mod cons. I especially like the huge bath tubs.    They have just renovated the pool and even thou its small its just what you need after a long days shopping in the centre of pattaya.    I noticed that they have just added a new \"wing\" to the hotel and the rooms thou very different in style (modern contemporary) they are amazingly priced at 1,300 baht.    Overall this hotel is a great little hidden gem, the staff are friendly and helpful, the food is good and cheap.    most of all it is great value for money i dont think i have stayed anywhere for this kind of value    I will be returning!! oi_tom wrote a review Jul 2008\n",
      "50 A little great hotel This is a great little hotel on Jomtien soi 4. About 50 meter to the beach. The price is good and the rooms are big, We stayed 2 weeks in Lana suite and the room was wery beatiful with big bathroom, dinning area and kitchen, but the balcony was very small (not furniture).  Nirvana have a new \"sister hotel\" Nirvana coulture rooms ,whith rooms for about 1000 baths/night, next door. I think the hotel also is good. MonicaFinland wrote a review Feb 2008\n",

      "50 Nirvana boutique suites. I am surprised this wonderful hotel is not even listed in the Pattaya hotels here on tripadvisor. A small 3 story hotel, is located only one block from Jomtien beach in the heart of Pattaya. The prices are reasonable, the suites are large, clean and beautifully decorated. The small lobby as well, is beautiful, the staff friendly and the whole place has a very nice family atmosphere. The kitchen is clean and the food is great as well. The pool is very small, reasonable private and a great place to relax if the sound of scooters passing through the back alley doesn't bother you. I would definitely recommend the Nirvana and will stay there again when we go back. Much better than one of those huge impersonal generic hotels. Pasjah wrote a review Feb 2007\n"

      "50 Weekend getaway! I haven't foreseen that much toward the start of our stay, realizing that it's been the condo owners to opening their condo units to tourists visiting in Jomtien. Genuinely, I love the idea, the only experienced I've discovered is that making sure that you'll get the condo owner's contact number upon reserving online otherwise, you'll end up in a long wait. Overall, our stay was fantastic, it feels like home with a touch of holiday atmosphere. Kyd T. Masong wrote a review Nov 2019\n",
      "40 An Oasis of calm Firstly I should say that this is not a hotel, daily or weekly stays are prohibited by at least three statutes in Thailand. Be very wary of companies who take bookings for a short stays as you may find yourself turned away either by reception staff or when you try to get a key for the apartment. There are unscrupulous owners who are desperate to see a return on their investment so be careful.  1. Security at this resort is a premier consideration for the operators, gate security followed by security at reception followed by security in the elevators. The magnetic key will only allow access to the floor of your apartment and the swimming pool/ laundry/water machine ( floor 6) security staff patrol continuously and CCTV apparent everywhere.  2. The facilities are kept clean continuously, daily routines ensure all public areas are cleaned and where necessary polished. The regime appears relentless and those responsible deserve every visitors praise. Even the gardens are maintained daily.  3. The staff for the most part are courteous and polite to their visitors. There are some grumpy ones which you expect in such a large undertaking.  Excellent security,  Everywhere is kept clean  Staff for the most part are polite  This is not a hotel and daily and of weekly stays are not allowed, at least three statutes govern the way the place operates. We stayed for two months.  So those are the pros what about the cons:  1. There is a continual need for small change to feed both the water machine and the washer/dryer machines. There are a plethora of machines taking your money , vending for drinks etc, machines for phone chimes and games but no change machines. The money area does sometimes have the required change which is given out begrudgingly but be prepared to have the correct change available as they cannot be relied upon. There appears to have been some changes to the 1 baht coinage used in the drinking water machine such that it will take the old but not the new currency, we found if you soak the currency in water it is usually accepted by the machine.  2. These premises are not like a holiday hotel, so the available loungers and furniture tend to be taken early in the day and remain in the possession of the towel holder irrespective of whether they show through the day or not.  3. The major nation using the premises are Russian, they tend to proliferate the area and take over all the available facilities. The Chinese are next and they just shout at each other all the time.  4. The restaurant is not. It’s a small room with a gas hob preparing various dishes with some form of rice. I never got on with it and did not frequent after the first week or so.  5. The beach opposite is a disaster. The debris which includes plastic bottles and polystyrene, plastic cutlery washes in and out with the tide and is totally overwhelming.  6. Packs of wild ( possibly rabid) dogs hunt for food and appear to be disturbed at three o’clock in the morning not only barking but howling. I have a fear of dogs after being attacked as a child and found the dogs to be totally intimidating. The locals appear sanguin about their presence.  7. Fly tipping is endemic in the area adjacent to the resort and regular toxic fires are lit to burn the results of the tipping. Windows have to be shut and balconies cannot be used.  8. Whilst the “ second road” behind the resort is looked after, motor bikes without silencers appear to use it as part of a circuit and favour full throttle 10000rpm with the resulting noise at 4 am in the morning ( after the dogs howling which sets them off again)  9. The whole area is in need of a good scrub. The streets and pavements are filthy and whilst the garbage is collected daily the overriding smell is significantly distasteful.

      "30 Overall, totally disappointing. There was no real instruction on where to go on arrival, as there was no reception on the ground floor. We were told to go to the 5th floor and went to what we assumed was the reception, but it was actually the Juristic Office for the building. They were no help, and we were about to walk out thinking we had the wrong building.    On calling the number on the booking, we found that there was another office on the 5th floor where we were to go to. It was a travel office. Upon check-in, we were taken to the allocated room. The service finished there!    The signs on the 5th floor outside the lifts stated that this building did not have a 'Hotel Licence' and therefore people were not permitted to stay here overnight or short term. Fines applied for doing so. How confusing and confronting!    Nice beach and ocean view from our 15th-floor apartment. Some English speaking channels on the TV which we appreciated. WIFI worked well. No other positive that we can think of!    In our room, the mattress needs to be replaced as the sides collapse when someone sits on it. Mismatched bed linen that did not adequately cover the bad, e.g. Double Duvet on a Queen or King bed. Fitted sheets not fitting the mattress. Overall, totally disappointing.

      "10 TERRIBLE We booked a 3 bedroom apartment expecting something as shown in the photos on booking.com - NOTHING close!!! Decor was disgusting, old, mouldy, wallpaper peeling, EVERYTHING in an awful state of disrepair and/or broken. We have never witnessed 'accommodation' so dirty. Bed bases made us feel ill, as did the bathroom and poor excuse for a kitchen.    Wi-fi was a joke as was finding the place as no-where is 'Apartment Friendly' mentioned. Also, reception is not 24hrs - we were lucky to arrive (and depart) before 5pm as we just caught the check in lady at a place called Alex's Apartment. As far as I can work out these 'condos' are owned and rented by individuals so any photos you may see upon booking are NOT representative of what you actually get.    Needless to say we paid the ridiculous 3880 baht penalty to leave immediately and ended up with 2 rooms at the pleasant Citin Lofts, with brekky included at a rate still below the partially refunded shocking experience of Jomtien Plaza.

      "10 买家当心 Worst booking experience ever Totally UNHELPFUL management.    Booked D Varee on the wrong weekend. I called both the booking agency and the hotel booking office to get a very minor shift in the date -- the hotel refused to change the booking, even though there were plenty of rooms available. I was OK to pay a higher price, but they just refused outright. Lost the entire $$ I had already paid for the room, and I was unable to stay. So this review is giving them back their 2,200 baht lol    I would suggest finding a hotel that will actually talk directly and help paid customers...and in my case, a RETURNING customer. Instead, they just kept telling me to talk with the agent...who actually had called the hotel and DVaree had refused to make any change. So the agent asked me to talk directly. I called the hotel 3 times and they never helped me at all. In the end, I gave up.    Who would want to stay at a place that doesn't give a sh&t about their customers? Not me.    There are far better hotels in Jomtien that offer better customer service. tokyomike55 wrote a review Apr 2022\n",

They come through the wall cracks and the showers, and in back of the toilets, where no man has gone before or should go. I think this hotel needs to fumigate and stop using the old excuse that this is a tropical Country, sure, it is but you can contain them where guests stay. It is obvious they don't care will never come back here again as the front desk didn't do anything. They sprayed this nastiness in the room that almost made me pass out!

First, very non-responsive throughout the booking process and had to send them my flight details and passport on 3 separate occasions, due to their incompetence. Next, I fly from Singapore to Bangkok, line I have done on 4 other occasions during the pandemic (where I faced zero issues with hotels line the Hilton and the Avani), only to find that they did not send a car, as scheduled and confirmed, for pickup. How difficult is this? This hotel should be avoided for their laziness and incompetence… Brian H wrote a review Apr 2022\n",

      "10 Lousy Hotel Manager The hotel manager at this hotel does not care about the guests, he's only been on the job for 2 weeks and already he's ignoring complaints and concerns, he does nothing. Whoever hired him needs to find someone else quick!    The hotel, has no guests, it's literally a ghost town and no one speaks English to help you, so if you're a tourist that expects service you won't be getting it here. Staff take forever to do anything, even as simple as asking for a blanket you can wait an hour or you have to keep calling downstairs until someone comes.    Seems like they do not like foreigners here, as if they feel that foreigners have left them high and dry. Best to avoid this place and give business to hotels that have learned to appreciate the importance of tourism.    The price is low but rooms are dingy, small, and very depressing, the food is not good either. Many people have complained about the breakfast being dull and i will too, since i have eaten here before. This hotel has gone downhill since the pandemic with no signs of recovery in site. Might as well close down or sell it. I will definitely not return.    By the way if you want hard boiled eggs that are cold and look like they have been sitting around for hours or days this is what you will get here. They just don't care about anybody.

All rooms come with a sea view, and the I had was large enough, with comfortable bed and balcony. A safe locker. kettle free water, tea and coffee, free internet connection is included in the price. Aging is evident from malfunctioning of some of the electrical appliances. Average breakfast mostly oriented towards local customers. Great view from 38th floor bar. Great value for money.

Why would the hotel allow to book rooms when they cannot guarantee that booked room will be reserved or available.

      "40 Someone said incredible value, I second this! For what you pay, a stay at D Varee is a steal.    We had access to gym and roof pool without extra cost. The hotel has a sky bar and friendly staff that will help you if you have any questions. To get into Pattaya Central you can simply jump on the bus for 10bath each and it'll take you all the way to Pattaya beach. Same with the way back, obv.  Once you return, the best bedding in the world is waiting for you. Like, seriously, I'd like to know where they buy their duvets and sheets because I need to order me some!    PS: Don't send your clothes to laundry service. The prices are outrageous.    Suggestions for improvements:  - update their information. They kept giving us the wrong information for third party things, and the staff didn't seem fully informed (once we were sent up to the skybar for food, when the food serving had closed. Another time we waited half an hour for the free shuttle bus (which we never took in the end) before they realised the times had changed).  - the receptionists didn't really seem happy to see us, which made us feel a little bit unwelcome whenever we were at the reception. But the rest of the hotel was really friendly. Chase N wrote a review Mar 2020\n",
      "50 INCREDIBLE VALUE AWAY FROM THE MADNESS DOWNTOWN I just finished spending 3 weeks in this hotel and I wish I was back there right now. It isn't a new hotel and the rooms are a little dated but what it lacks in sparkle it more than makes up for in other ways. The staff is incredible. The security guard by the elevator (short hair, I wish I knew her name) gave me a HUG every morning on my way out. The lobby coffee shop staff saved me pieces of my favorite cake (Chocolate Brownie Cheesecake OMG!). The concierge upgraded our baseline airport taxi to a luxury SUV without even saying anything. I could go on and on about how chill and cool the place is. The breakfasts were amazing. The neighborhood and Jonpiem Beach had lots of interesting shops and restaurants and you weren't in the middle of chaos every night like the places by walking street. If you want a more \"chill\" Pattaya experience, if you are in town for business or with a family or for a romantic getaway with your lover this place is for you. Sit on the balcony and watch the sunset and feel all of your cares drift away on the sweet tropical breezes. Joe C wrote a review Feb 2020\n",

      "20 On February 17, we were met at the reception by indifferent people. No help We ask you to replace us with a hotel room! We rested at this hotel twice. Everything was great. We reduced our stay in Patong to 3 days at our favorite hotel D varee. They paid for their stay in advance from February 17-27. We used to live in room 2315. And they promise us nov to give the room even higher. But on arrival at the given number 250 second floor.  We said that we do not need a second floor. only higher. At the reception they answered to take a room above the second floor you need to pay five hundred baht for each day of stay. we really asked to replace the room here two beds we need one big. the room has an unpleasant smell. the corridor smells of paint. it smells very stylish with bleach from the pool when it is cleaned by our room nearby. Our balcony was flooded with black, sewage. It smelled bad. But the number was not replaced by us. we do not know English and the letter is written using a computer. The hotel is very nice! great restaurant. varied menu with a wide selection of dishes. Two large pools and an excellent fitness room. here you can enjoy your vacation on the first line from the sea. nice atmosphere. but indifferent, disrespectful people at the reception. We travel often. and really liked this hotel. but forced to abandon him. spoiled rest. and also in our issue a very weak wi-fi. we will be here until February 27th.

      "20 Vacation We stayed here two years ago and were reasonably happy. In two years the rooms are looking tired. The breakfast is still quite good and the maid was very pleasant and efficient.    However, we come to Pattaya to play golf. We used a car service parked in front of the hotel two years ago he was excellent. Since then the hotel has brought the taxi service in house. We used the service Friday to go to a course and the cost was higher than Grab but convenient (1500 vs 1200 bhat). We used it again today to go to the same golf course. However, the dispatcher directed the driver to take us to a different golf course and the driver charged us an additional 300 bhat for the inconvenience of taking us to the wrong course. We are going to the same course tomorrow but have arranged an alternative service at a lower cost.    I raised my concern with the duty manger. While he apologized he seemed disinterested at best.

      "40 2 nights Hotel is big. Good service.  Room is good. Bath. Balcony. Adjustable airconditioning is great.  Breakfast is ok, but seen much better. Coffee was almost cold (Because of the too big 10l thermobottle)  Seaside view in Amazing from 28 floor. Kattiri wrote a review Dec 2019\n",
      "30 Spacious jotel We were here for 3 nights. The room was large and had a small kitchenette and small bathroom. It had a good size balcony with a sea view. I didn’t like the fact the shower is over the bath, but it worked fine. The room was tired and dated. There are two swimming pools which were very nice with sun beds and towels. We wouldn’t stay here again as there are better value hotels with nicer rooms. I also agree with some other reviews that when we arrived there were 4 members of staff on check in, not one of them smiled or even said hello. Housekeeping and restaurant staff were smiley. The hotel is at the quieter end of Jomtien beach 30 minutes walk from the hustle & bustle but there are regular baht buses. Sharon C wrote a review Dec 2019\n",
      "10 Disgusting - dirty facilities, rude staff Absolutely the worst hovel I have ever stayed i. The room overlooked a tramps smoking/toilet area the smell of urine was over powerful. Staff rude, car park full of jet skis, Disgusting decor and very slow water with low pressure. I have stayed in worse places when I ws a Japanese PoW but even then some of the camps were better. Management should be ashamed of themselves, they should pay us to stay there. Never again. Nicktw wrote a review Dec 2019\n",

      "40 Nice stay Not a bad hotel if you manage your expectations. I stayed in a superior room with oceanview on the 17th floor with great view. The room itself needed some painting and modernisation but it was clean and had a big fridge and electric kettle for making your own coffee. Nice balcony with 2 chairs and a table, all basic. The airco worked very well but makes some noice. There is a free safe on the room. I found the bed very comfortable and I had clean sheets everyday. The girl who did my room was very friendly and cleaned it daily very well, she made a huge possitive difference! I did not use the pools or breakfast so no comment on that but there are many small restaurants in the neighbourhood and the beach is just across the street. Staff in generally were friendly and helpfull although they forgot to bring my suitcase upstairs so it was standing in the lobby against a wall, anyone could have taken it I guess and after an hour waiting I took it myself. I paid around 35 euroos a night so very cheap and for that reason price/ quality was ok. The hotel is located at the quite part if jomtien but there are many bathbuses driving up and down the road. Would I book it again? I certainly would consider it. Andre wrote a review Oct 2019\n",
      "10 This hotel is the worst Booked in a night - 2 adults and 2 kids so we booked two rooms and asked for adjoining rooms. Price was about 2000 baht each - I was shown a disgusting room on the second floor with my kids' room across the hall. Both were equally gross. Broken floor, stains on the walls and the smell was horrific. I refused to stay in that room. They showed us another and it was on the 5th floor and it was pretty gross as well. Kids' room miles away. They said if I upgraded then I could stay in a suite. It was nice - two bedrooms, on the 22cd floor. I had to pay an extra 3500 baht for it. So it cost 7500 for one night. It was ridiculous. Staff were rude and I would never go back again. antoinette k wrote a review Oct 2019\n",
      "40 Good Value I am a solo traveler and I stayed at the D varee for two nights, I booked the room on the 2nd floor which are the cheaper rooms without any sea views but the room was quite large had a comfortable bed and there was good facilities in the room when you consider they are the cheapest options, there was an extensive choice of channels on the TV including Astra sports and also for English speaking films, there is free tea and coffee, hair dryer, safe inside the wardrobe. The deco and the furniture in these cheaper rooms disparately in need of an upgrade but for the price you pay I guess one shouldn’t complain. The pool on the 5th floor is excellent with a nice area to relax and plenty of loungers. I did not have the breakfast but the reviews I read were positive. As for the Location it is at the far end near the beach road but a long walk to the main centre or you can hop on a Sontel i.e. small bus.  My dealing with staff was good from the security to the receptionist, and chamber maids. So overall I would book this hotel again but one of the more expensive rooms. kor4at wrote a review Sep 2019\n",

Sea facing rooms with balcony are awesome...the roof top sky bar is best to sit n relax in the evening... So clean... Staff where very nice n polite... The only draw back is that staffs don't speak or understand English... Only 1 or 2 staff understands English to some extent... So language was a big problem for us... This area is not popular for indian tourists as in the entire hotel there was no other Indian tourist during our stay i.e on 31st Dec'18 n 1st jan'19 (New Year). Getting cab was a problem for us.

      "40 A cracking couple of weeks I recently stayed at The D Varee Hotel in Jomtiem Beach with my girl friend and my dad.Our rooms had excellent sea views and were spacious and clean. The hotel as a good gym and 2 very good pools for swimming and relaxing. Loctation wise its a 2 minute walk from a beautiful pattaya beach. Both the beach and sea were clean. Its the quieter part of town which suits us and the busier parts are easily accessible by taxi or baht food. To be honest my girlfiend and i didnt eat much in the hote as we prefer exploring the local thai / fish restaurants. We ate very well throughout our stay. My dad had breakfast every day and reported that it was very good value for money. He did say the staff at breakfast were very helpful but were too eager to clear his table when he had only got up to get another dish or coffee. The hotel stall on the whole were helpful , polite and seemed happy in thier work.The onsight cafe does serve and excellent choice of sandwiches, cakes , ice creams hot and cold drinks etc. We will most definately go back Dave wrote a review Jun 2019\n",

      "40 Quiet place to stay Stayed for 4 nights with my sister and some friends. We booked for 3 superior double rooms which is their lowest price room and located in the lower floors. The rooms, however, are not cheap looking. They are quite cozy and they even have a balcony.    The breakfast spread, unfortunately, was abyssmal and repetitive. Not really 4-star quality but more of a 3. They do have a rooftop bar and the cocktails were quite affordable and to die for. They could have pick a better DJ though.    We didn’t really try the other facilities like the spa (expensive!) and fitness center as most of the time we were out. The place, by the way, is in Jomtien, far away from the hustle and bustle of Pattaya so there’s not much of a happening in the area. The hotel is suitable for families and those who just want to have a quiet place to stay. Jeff wrote a review Apr 2019\n",
      "40 rooftop bar went to their rooftop bar some years ago no one their, very quite, no atmosphere, how ever now its all changed its like a new place, we saw the place on an app for discount food so we thought we would give it another try, prices of the food were excellent with the discount, food was fantastic we eat off the tapas menu, drink were at happy hour prices buy 1 get 1 free had many people there some music and see the sunset. i would say they are in the process of doing some very good marketing which is working we will be back there again very soon. only one negative comment the rooftop bar start its happy hour at 6pm which really only give you 20 or 30 minutes before the sun has gone would be better if started happy hour at 5pm. gofasteddie wrote a review Apr 2019\n",

Rooms were basic, certainly nothing to brag about, but the hotel itself is large and very busy, with lots of Chinese tour groups coming and going. Breakfast was excellent, with an excellent selection, but very full, and at times we found ourselves dodging people. Staff was friendly and helpful and we enjoyed our stay here.

The rooms were dated but clean and the sea views were superb.  Don't bother with the rooftop cocktail bar (which is the main reason we chose D Varee). The cocktails were truly awful and when it started filling up with Chinese and Thais in their pyjamas with noisy children, we drank up and left. Not what we expected at all.  If you want amazing sea views at a reasonable price, D Varee is great. But that's about it. Banksyboy wrote a review Feb 2019\n",

      "30 Nice place to stay, but the room needed some TLC Stayed at this hotel for six nights in early December    Location -- The hotel is on Jomtien Beach a place that feels like the family friendly side of Pattaya. Taxis are harder to find in this area, but there are plenty of Tok Tok trucks to take. Our group of 8 got to the walking area for about 200 baht total.    Staff -- Very nice and helpful at the front desk and in the restaurants.    Internet -- Yes, Internet is free, but was not reliable. Most nights we could not get on line.    Amenities -- Even though the beach is just across the street, there are two better pools on site. The hotel has a gym for free, it has a large amount of real gym equipment to use.    Free Breakfast -- Yes, A good buffet style breakfast with many Asian and American breakfast options.    Room -- The room is why I have this hotel an average rating. The room needed some TLC, the walls needed some paint to cover up the dirt on it, and the bathroom needed a good re-caulking. On the bright side the room is large, and has an amazing view of the beach.    Would I stay there Again? Yes, but i would be tempted to try other options. Nick K wrote a review Dec 2018\n",

The receptionist did not even tell us what time for breakfast.  They promoted the outsources spa in the hotel, but when we called the spa, the staffs were so rude, and the hotel staffs just said that the spa is not under their responsibility or control.  We visited the roof top bar for our both nights and never be impressed since the bar staffs were always pout and never even welcome customer to the bar or had alertness to take order.

      "10 Awful.. just awful Decided to get away for a few days and decided upon this hotel, as a lot of hotels were either fully booked or no where near the beach. This was on the quieter Jomtien Beach.    Booked a deluxe room with club access. Stayed in many club access lounges around Thailand so knew what to expect (I am a thai expat).    When you first arrive at the hotel it looks very grand and clean. However, appearances can be very deceptive. The room is extremely tired and old. The furniture is tattered and shabby. There is no shower, just a tiny bath with a shower in it (I’m 190 cm tall so couldn’t stand up).    The breakfast though is by far the worst. As a “club lounge” guest you dine on the 38th floor for breakfast. Over the stay of our holiday we went up to have breakfast at 5 different times. Ranging from 6:45 - 9:30am. However, due to the size of the room where you have breakfast there is no where ever to sit and most of the time hardly any food for the the number of guests. A lot of the guests were not club lounge members (as they mentioned) but as they don’t check your room number it’s kind of a “free for all system”.    Club lounge in the evening gets you free cocktails, beer or alcohol. It’s buy one get one free anyway. And if you’re club guests they give you minimal wine anyway.    Stay away from this hotel. If you do stay here please don’t waste your money on club rooms. Kglen wrote a review Oct 2018\n",
      "30 Ok but room for improvement On arrival at the hotel we were placed in a room in the low front block which to be honest was a bit dingy. When we returned to our room after dinner the smell was so bad we had to request another room. We were moved to a room on a higher floor which was roomy but could have done with a bit of maintenance. The beds were comfortable and the balcony overlooking the beach was large and quite private. We did have to request the internet to be attended to which turned out to be a router problem after which we were happy with the room. The lobby and reception staff were always very helpful.  The thing that we were disappointed with were the overpriced buffet breakfast that was of poor quality, and the staff were totally uninterested. Companion633836 wrote a review Oct 2018\n",
      "30 Beautiful sea view / Average hotel . Just had 17 nights at this hotel , its a nice hotel but well used , it needs some modernisation throughout . The Hotel is all about the Ocean view which is Beautiful , so make sure you book a Ocean view room .  The rooms are ok size with ok furniture , but does have a good size balcony ,Staff / cleaning staff and security are very good . The Hotel is in a good location and close to all attraction and the beach .  Now some bad things , My room had no hot water , The Boiler system for the room needed servicing or replacing , Hotel maintenance came 13 times to reset the boiler , which would then give me hot water for about 6 hours once reset .  Also the electrical box for the room is in the kitchen cupboard with exposed live wires ,  The DIB sky bar on the roof tried to over charge us , the bill should have been 180 bart for 2 drinks in happy hour 2 drinks for price of 1 , they tried to charge me 480 bart , so we never went back to the Sky bar which was a shame .  Food in the restaraunt is average and expensive , Service charge and VAT is then added to the bill , the price on the menu is what i want to pay with no hidden extra . Also my room came with 10% off food and this was also never given to me .    Yes i would stay at this Hotel again if only just for the ocean view . markhowardmagnetic wrote a review Oct 2018\n"

      "30 Little dissapointed We arrived at the D Varee and was allocated a room on the 29the floor. The reception area was clean and good looking. The room was spacious and clean. The balcony needed cleaning and was very windy. Towels could be replaced. As a test I left the card in the bed to save the planet. They did adhere and did not replace the bedding and towels. This hotel is purely catering for groups and conferences. The dining area is noisy and unpleasant. Being ushered into this huge restaurant with no atmosphere. The food quality was good and staff work very hard to keep serving dishes full. The room floor is extreemly slippery and my husband slipped one night entering the bathroom and injured his back and knee. Pool areas are pleasant. Had terrible time getting wi-fi sorted out. First day no wi-fi in the room and IT manager only managed to fix this the following afternoon, but then it had the speed of lightning. Was not a cheap hotel, so expected more.

I won't return to this hotel and won't recommend to others.. sofi s wrote a review Aug 2018\n",
      "50 Lovely Hotel, Great Location, Terrific Staff Staying at Dvaree Hotel and have found it to be awesome. I had a small issue that was immediately fixed by the staff. The hotel is located in a great place right in front of the beach. It has two amazing swimming pools and several eateries. The rooms are really great and offer wonderful ocean views. The staff are terrific. I would recommend this hotel to any travelers. I look forward to when I come back. BruceRichards wrote a review Aug 2018\n",
      "40 Great location Great location, near the beach. You can see the beach from the hotel and walk across the road. Also, there are ready-to-eat food and 7/11 shop in 2 minuets walk. I stayed at family room which is big and cozy. Anyway, I have allergy and it’s a bit dust in the room. Great view from the room on 19th floor. Ice Pat wrote a review Aug 2018\n",

      "30 Need improvements We stayed there for 2 nights in deluxe room, the hotel receptionists were nice but forgot to inform about breakfast time which really need for hotel job. The room was good and clean, but the extra bed was quite expensive for this kind of hotel and breakfast.    The F&B Service staffs at Bar (Roof top bar) were rude and terrible (only a male adult staff was so nice). They never concentrated customer, nobody for host, and even customers got in the bar, they just ignored.  As well, even when we had problem and would like to complain so we called them but a bar girl just looked at us with pout face and just walled away?????? I think, she doesn’t suit service job.  They also forgot to keep a knife from table after cleaning (or maybe, they didn’t clean).    Also, F&B Service staff in breakfast restaurant looks lazy and don’t want to work. They look bored and no energy.  Anyway, F&B Service staff in the dining restaurant at downstair was so nice. OneyOransuksun wrote a review Aug 2018\n",

      "10 The worst hotel I’ve ever met !! Pls be aware before you make a reservation!! It’s a beautiful hotel first of all check-in was lovely and very smooth.The staff confirmed that we got late check out until 4pm i was very surprised and appreciated!! K.Niran concierge escorted us to the room his service is outstanding. we staying in 2312 executive club room with ocean view on 20-21july. however the view are fantastic!! rooftop bar staff was ok service was very slow. during breakfast on 38th floor the food is hight quality delicious and i loved the variety. The scrambled eggs and omelette is very salty so we ask the staff to change to normal fried eggs because this is too salty. He took our plate and made the new order with the chef directly after that he came back to informed us that the new plate will coming nearly soon and he apologized for the food. I don’t feel angry at all until we waited for the eggs but no one served us we also waited until they finished the breakfast time!! hahaha this is so funny no one replace us the new dish no one courtesy! so we just left the restaurant after we done with the breakfast we went to the front desk to make sure that our keycard still work until4pm the receptionist did the new key for us to access the door until departure time 4pm so we went to the gusto uno cafe for a cup of coffee around noon during coffee time the receptionist called me on my cellphone and ask me to checkout because checkout time is 12:00PM. I informed her that I got the late check out until4PM she said sorry but can not the late checkout is subject availability I was shocked and feels embarrassed because 2 staff at front desk confirmed me that my room got late checkout until 4pm so I just go back to the room and came down to checkout immediately!! This is the worst service worst hotel I’ve ever met before this is so terrible! I never post any negative comments on social networks i always reviews the positive thing but this is too much for me. i will keeps posting this kind of embarrassing in this hotel on the social to let everyone be aware of this crazy hotel!!

      "20 Birthday getaway disaster! My best friend and I have decided to book a room at D Varee for my birthday weekend getaway. We compared rates and reviews of hotels through Booking.com and Agoda and I'm the one who chose D Varee over 3 top choices because of very good reviews. Good decision not to book for 2-nights. I should've read reviews here in Tripvisor earlier! It was a disaster! The room we were given was old, smell like molds, airconditioner is dirty, floor is dirty, toilet bowl was not even clean! Still thankful that we were given another room which is a so-so, I paid 2,350 but still not worth it! Then while we're waiting for complimentary drink, we've decided to kill the time at Gusto Uno. The chocolate cheesecake was good, I had it with Thai Iced Tea but we smelled like miso soup because this cafe is next to a Japanese buffet restaurant! While we were chatting, my best friend screamed because she saw a small rat crawling out the coffee machine! I was not able to take the photo because I was shocked and when the staff heard us and tried be near the rat, it went back to coffee machine! I could not finish my Thai Iced tea anymore.. Yuck so gross!    Then the next day, we were excited to have breakfast because I super like bacons, I read from Booking.com that their breakfast esp bacon was nice. We're suppose to go to Garden Cafe but was led by front staff to Frix restaurant. That place is a mess! I could not post all the photos we took but all I can say is it was a mess! People having breakfast came in groups. Some were wearing a company shirt. While some were in group tour. My best friend lose her appetite so she didn't eat at all. The food was bland. I ate just to give it a try and I must say, it was not a 4-star style breakfast. Bacon was cooked late and it looks poorly done. I did not eat all in my plate and more groups arrived so we hurriedly walked out. When we came out from Frix, we saw couples, friends, families having breakfast at Garden Cafe. That restaurant looks clean and organized. So when we checked out, I asked the receptionist why we were not allowed to eat at Garden Cafe. She replied, \"it's only for group and seminar participants\". WTF!    I still give 2 stars because the staff were polite. Myra B wrote a review Jul 2018\n",

Horrible is breakfast. We have group of 40 pax and informed much in advance, that please, provide some Indian Veg. food, but Ohh... nothing was there.

      "20 Disappointing We stayed here on the second floor for three weeks. From the outset we didnt think the room met the standards that the hotel claimed. Ripped, old tired wallpaper and rooms very dingy as they are poorly lit. Two different times sheets with rips were put on our bed which i dont think is acceptable. The room was very tired looking not to mention the aircon unit which was held together barely with tape and was extremely noisy and dripped constantly throughout the last night. Other noise was a big problem especially from Chinese tourists who stayed for one or two nights then left very early banging doors and shouting between rooms and down corridor. This could be all various times throughout the night then noise from cleaners would start. Why put long stay with short stay residents?? We did complain once about this but it only made a difference for one night and we received some flowers from the cleaner then went back to normal for rest of the holiday. We actually went and stayed in another hotel one night just to get some sleep! Other points i want to mention include the fact there is nowhere to sit and plug hairdryer in - the hairdryer lead was not long enough to reach any mirror?? Wi-fi constantly dropping in and out in our room. I called reception at least 3 times throughout the holiday and to be fair they acted quickly to sort it but very frustrating as the wifi was usually almost non-existent regularly by the two pools. Food and drink very over priced. We have visited Thailand many times but felt this time got ripped off not only with our room but at the pool. For example 14 baht at local shop for fanta and 70 baht by hotel pool which is just as much if not more than what you would pay in England. This was the same with the food so we rarely purchased food or drink. We found most of the staff pleasant enough but I doubt we will ever go and stay there again on any further trips to Jomtien as we felt we didnt get value for our money here and i certainly wouldnt say it is 4 star like they claim.

      "10 Terrible You must be mad to stay there!!  First to be fare are the good points friendly staff for the most part and nice pools  Now for the bad  The room was very old holes with holes in wall paper small taty looking bathroom.  The air conditioning unit was held together with tape it leaked on the floor we even had holes in the bed sheets  This hotel is used for Chinese short stay tours they open the bedroom doors and shout at each other from 4 in the morning so you don't get much sleep. The staff shout each other from around 6 doors banging all morning.  You won't be able to catch a hour by the pool both are used by children and the shouting and screaming is rediculess unfortunately parents don't control them even after the staff have a word with them  I will never stay again when you consider the price you can get much more for your money Matthew B wrote a review Jun 2018\n",
      "40 Nice place and nice view Our stay could have been perfect if it was not screwed by a staff who knocked in our room and talked to me rudely on the phone as she wanted us out of the room. We requested for a late check-out and was granted up to 1 p.m. At about 12:30 noon a lady knocked in our room. My partner told her we are to check out at 1p.m. After few minutes I received the call in the phone and the voice of the staff was demanding and rude. I told her we are to check out at 1 p.m. but she said it is already 1 p.m. when it was just 12:45 p.m. She said we would be charged extra if we don't leave and told us to leave after 10 minutes (before 1 p.m.) I was disgusted and told the reception staff when we checked out. The reaction at the reception was that she did not know anything about the staff calling us and sort of surprised because it was recorded in their system that we would check out at 1p.m.    Anyhow, the hotel is very nice and would love to stay there again. The room with seaview is large, clean, balcony and a fantastic view. Their buffet have enough food to fill-up the stomach and they have two restaurants to use. Their lobby is wide and have a coffee shop of their own. The location is great too because one can just cross the road to be at the seaside. They have two pools and a cozy, nice rooptop bar. There are nice restaurants nearby also. Angel F wrote a review Jun 2018\n",
      "30 OK but not brilliant! We arrived and found we had no small notes for the taxi who had no change. My husband went to reception to ask them to change a smaller note to pay the taxi. The receptionist did not say hello, welcome or anything just flung the smaller notes at my husband! We then both checked in which was very robotic and went to our room. We paid for a delux room on the 22nd floor. Personally I wouldn't bother, there was nothing delux about it except the increased cost! The room was clean but could do with some maintenance. I discussed this with the Reception who just flatly refused to do anything except confirm it was a delux room. I questioned the standard of the delux room and again all I was told was \"yes this is a delux room, sorry I don't understand\". We gave up. Breakfast was OK but every morning we had to wait for the table to be cleared and cleaned. The coffee is disgusting and the whole coffee area is dirty including the cups. The pool area was nice but you had to get a sunbed before 8 or not at all. We wouldn't return as there are better places to stay in Pattaya! saskianozz wrote a review Jun 2018\n"

      "40 For the price the view alone was worth it Booked 3 nights at this hotel, the room was not flash, but clean and wow was the ocean view spectacular. Was worth it just for the view.  Everything was fine, no complaints except noisy Chinese and Koreans who are oblivious to anyone else and show little manners.  The hotel has 2 pools, I used the pool on the 5th floor which was lovely and very clean.  The breakfast had a large choice for buffet most of it cold but I loved the variety.  Check in and check out was smooth.  Definitely would stay again and can recommend but we are talking a room rate of A$80 and it was good value and for my Aussie friends it had Australia Plus tv.

Liked its pool view the most, its location is good just few steps away from beach. You can enjoy sunset view from Hotel room.

You pay as you go in and beer is 80thb for a large bottle. You are shown to a table given a BBQ pot you then choose from the extensive array of food, not only seafood but meat sausages salad and rice. There are soft drinks free and ice cream and fruit afterwards. You can stay as long as you want, worth the effort to find, it’s a large open to the elements buffet restaurant. Be careful the prawns are alive and can jump off the BBQ. junction3 wrote a review Apr 2018\n",

      "40 Some improvement needed but overall ok 12 nights holiday stay.    Checkin ok, but understanding of spoken and written English is poor.    The room was tired and in need to renovation, given that this is a busy hotel some money needs reinvesting in the general decor and fittings in the bathroom and the room itself, however it was spotlessly clean, serviced well every day and the beds where comfortable. The rooms have spectacular views with amazing sunsets.    Breakfast, in the downstairs dinning room was a real “bun fight” with the atmosphere of a shopping mall. The food catered for the large number of Chinese and Asian visitors on the numerous tour buses that use the hotel. Breakfast on the 38th floor was a tranquil and much better experience, although again the Chinese flavours predominate.    Given the large number of tours the reception seating area turns into a bus terminal, with the accompanying noise and bustle, the lifts can also be crowded during these times.    The staff are generally friendly, although with a language barrier not seen in other 4* hotels in Thailand.    Many Russian guests who can be quite rude and loud. ABRDF wrote a review Mar 2018\n",

Service is great, staff very friendly and professional.  I really don't have anything to complain about the hotel, everything was perfect.  Hotel has it's own pool, so you can enjoy swimming, since beach and the sea are too dirty to go there. We were so disappointed by Jomtien and Pattaya, we were not expecting such level of dirtiness, I even ended up with serious infection here for being only 5 minutes in the sea. If you go mainly for swimming and enjoying on the beach, I recommend to go to some other location.  Anyway, D Varee Jomtien Beach Hotel is great and they made my stay in Jomtien pleasant.

      "40 Away from the hubbub! Pattaya is known for its diversified travelers. If you want to stay away from the crowded Pattaya Central, De Varee is a great hotel to stay within a budget. Located at the heart of Jomtien, De Varee is one of the largest hotel of Pattaya.  The hotel is right beside the beach, you can just wake up and go for a swim.  The rooms are spacious, open, and clean. The view from the room is spellbinding as you can enjoy the ocean right in front of you. The balcony is big enough to sit and relax with a bottle of beer or a glass of wine.  The bathrooms are clean too. It would’ve been great if they were a bit bigger but you can’t complain if you consider the room and its cleanliness.  The hotel staffs are helpful. They always take care of your requirements, let that be at any hour.  The pool and pool side are fantastic to have a great time with friends, family or all by yourself.  The Pattaya Central is just 10 minute drive from the hotel. The tuktuk will take 10/15 baht for one way to central or walking street.  In a nutshell, you can have all your Pattaya experiences staying in this calm and quite hotel. Fun and peace at the same time! BeardedTravelerr wrote a review Jan 2018\n",
      "30 It has potential Huge hotel. Old building and old furniture. Quiet location but lots of shops around. Beach in front is unfortunatly not clean. This needs collective attention by all business in the area as it gives a bad reputation.    Check in went fast. No language problem, the staff spoke English. We got a family suite on 26th floor. Good view over the sea from living and bedrooms, but small bedroom had a view over a parking area. Suite was overpriced for the standard and services, B6000 per night.    The kitchinette had only a fridge, water boiler and cups. But we didn't come to cook and Jomtien is full of food and inexpensive restaurants.    Internet mostly fast and reliable, almost 6 Mbps down and over 2 up.    Slept good in the quiet bedrooms. The beds are fine and as usual in this part of the world, on the firm side.    Good breakfast with lots of different food and friendly staff. Not a lot of people eating on 38th floor, most ate their breakfast in the ground floor.    Bathrooms were OK but smelled. However, water pressure was excellent.    Check out was also done fast.    A word of caution. This hotel has only low barriers at balchonies and corridors to the rooms. If we traveled with lively young children we would not stay here.    A few recommendations.    The dinner included with the family package was huge. It could easily feed 8. We were 3. Focus on quality instead of quantity.    Stop offering soft drink as free drink to adults. Offer at least a glass of wine, beer or sparkling wine.    Provide more and comfortable furniture for the balchonies. We had 2 chairs and a small table for our 3 balchonies in a suite for 4. After all the hotel is marketed for its sea view from all rooms.    But all in all an enjoyable stay. Stefan E wrote a review Jan 2018\n",

      "30 Mixed feelings Beautiful view is certainly not enough to compensate for overworn rooms in dire need of renovations and upgrade (the suites are basic). Balconies would benefit from comfortable furniture rather than the current odd selection of horrid wooden benches.  Services from breakfast to reception are... Hampered by the constant tidal waves of hundred of extremely noisy and often rude or inconsiderate chinese tourists who, to be honest, can really kill the mood.  In particular they like to block at least one of the three lifts to give time to the whole family to hop on. A lil game that in effects bars a third of the lifts for more than 5 minutes at times.annoying.  I would certainly try somewhere else next time but have no hard feelings.

      "30 Overhyped No doubt it is the best property around in terms of facilities. However, service is very low in standard if you plan to visit peak season. We had ordered something and got something else not once but three times. Language is a problem! For such a property where you have lot of foreigners coming... The swimming pool is amazing, there is a kids room nice small garden area..Breakfast on 38th floor is amazing if you are on time...again if you go after 8 it is chaos as we saw only 1 lady serving the whole breakfast area.. Overall it was good stay enjoyed Christmas!!! Lovely view.. Debalina DG wrote a review Jan 2018\n"

      "30 Hotel My husband and I together with our daughter plus another 2 friends checked into D Varre Jomtien for 7 nights. When we were shown our superior rooms, we were not happy with the rooms. We asked for an upgrade and was allocated executive club rooms which we have took but also have to pay the difference. Even the executive club rooms looked tired and the furnishings in need of modernisation. There was also inconsistencies such as our room has no slippers, bathrobes or sofa compared to the other two rooms occupied by my daughter and our friend. The positives in this hotel are the great seaview and convenience in terms of beach, restaurants, bars and launderette. I was rather disappointed with the buffet breakfast and definitely not value for money. Cheefoong wrote a review Dec 2017\n",
      "40 Jomtien Having stayed in Pattaya many many times, it was a totally different experience staying in Jomtien. Jomtien is much quieter than Pattaya, with much less night life. The hotel was good, nice and clean, good swimming pools, bars and restaurants. Keith P wrote a review Dec 2017\n",
      "40 Almost perfect! Plus: Quick check-in, very good WIFI, nice room, wonderful view, nice pools, close to the water, very good breakfast, nice and helpful staff, clean and good room service.    Minus: Small issues like forgetting water at rooms, small details in rooms andservices A K wrote a review Dec 2017\n",
      "40 Great location The rooms are large although the fixtures and fittings are quite dated.  The rooms we used had king sized bed, smart TV, double wardrobe, safe, small kitchen with fridge freezer, sink and hob. Although not all rooms had the sink and hob.  The bathroom has a shower over the bath, large sink and toilet.  Towels are changed daily and beds made.up daily.  Each rooms gets two bottles of water, 2 sachets of coffee, creamer and sugar daily.  The lobby is huge and very ornate with a pianist several nights a week.  There is a coffee shop in the lobby and plenty of sofas and armchairs.  Free WiFi available but you need to ask reception for a username and password if you wish to have it in your room.  The breakfast has a massive selection for various tastes and cultures.  There is also an outside restaurant and bar that has a live band a couple of times a week. Cheech6366 wrote a review Dec 2017\n",
      "40 Short, weekend trip Pretty good hotel with a comfortable pricing. While it is slightly off beat from the central Pattaya, it is not uncomfortable. Surrounded by couple of departmental stores and good eateries with the hotel itself providing restaurant facilities, you are never challenged to have your choicest food which Pattaya so well cater. While we went as a couple to spend our wedding anniversary, I will recommend this hotel even for a family stay with young children as I can surely think of bringing my daughter here also along with. kaushik76 wrote a review Dec 2017\n",
      "40 Breakfast lacks variety Very well located hotel on the beach front.Good panoramic view of the sea if you pay for the right view; a bit over crowded sometimes.Clean and neat; well kept rooms and house keeping is immaculate. The seminar rooms are not up to the mark though and they seem to concentrate on the hotel rather than MICE.  The breakfast lacks variety but a big spread.  Access to public transport is only the red vans and they will fleece often, be careful. SRamnath wrote a review Dec 2017\n",
      "40 Holiday This hotel is across the road from the beach with fantastic views . The hotel is very clean and tidy, with helpful friendly staff . We didn't use the restaurant but the coffee shop has lovely cakes and salads . There are 2 lovely swimming pools, with plenty of sun loungers and poolside bar and food. Jomtien is quieter than Pattaya but has plenty of restaurants, bars and shops. Taxi vans run all along the seafront to Pattaya and are very cheap. Really lovely hotel and perfect for families, and couples. Would stay again . hodgesplodge wrote a review Dec 2017\n",
      "40 Pretty good Not a bad hotel. Plenty of Chinese visitors with a handful of westerners. I get the impression it has had a big male over recently as the finishing snare new but architectural features seem a little dinky. The hotel hallways outside of the rooms are open air with waist height barriers- of you have kids that like to climb, I would stay well clear. The outdoor bar is nice enough with a cool sea breeze. Just down the road are a few dirt restaurants, but the food seemed good- yes I did get mild gastro from somewhere. We received advise not to use the tap water to brush your teeth but that may be a little extreme. I stayed on a two bedroom apartment - the room was clean and spacious with air conditioning. The balcony door could be left open but the smog made you want to close it. A decent hotel for business travellers- but families with small children should look elsewhere.

The so called Wifi is a frustration because you have to log in every time you turned a page! The pool is great and a big compensation for an almost non existing beach where you can swim!

Room size is okay, but the sheets upon check-in were stained so we asked to switch rooms. The location is not very nice either. I think you can do much better in Jomtien / Pattaya at the same price.

      "30 Not as good as expected. OK here are the good points.    1. Reception very helpful and friendly.  2. The massage in the spa package was very good.  3. The rooms were clean and in good order.  4. The staff were friendly at all times.    Now the bad things...  1. The internet and phone in the room didn't work. We went to reception three times and were eventually moved room. But it too three visits to reception.  2. Whoever ran the staff roster for breakfast should be fired. I know it was a holiday weekend, but the breakfast was so bad it spoilt the holiday. There was no where to sit so total strangers sat on out table. For two days there was no cutlery, no coffee cups and food pilled up on tables. Food on the floor and staff working at a snails pace. We were not told of a second dining room the fact there was no cloth to cover the bread meant the bread had everyones hands all over it. The potatoes were partially cooked and cold. It was too crowded and the staff over stretched. I would score is 1/10.    2. We booked the executive suite which seemed good value with the welcome drink. The welcome drink was half a glass of orange juice and nothing more. Not exactly the welcome we expected after waiting until 6pm.  3. There was no information in the room about tours or local information. Plus no guest services desk to ask for tours etc.    Overall, like most others, the hotel has a great location, nice style, but the rooms are looking a little old. The receptionists were great, the breakfast was terrible as they didn't manage the people or the cleaning.    I would come back again but wouldn't bother with the suite as it just meant extra room. They could have charged more and made more of the privileges or the service. Aky B wrote a review Oct 2017\n"

      "30 A beautiful flower without fragrance Stayed here from 27 Sep to 2 Oct with family in 6 rooms.  The first impression on arrival at 5 am at the lobby desk wasn't great itself. We already requested an early check-in prior to our arrival but even then we were charged full day tariff.  The rooms allotted to us were on the 29th floor. The rooms are of decent size and clean.  View of the sea from the room is the best part of this hotel.  The breakfast spread is \"Mostly\" non vegetarian. We are a strict vegetarian family therefore requested the restaurant manager to increase the items for the vegetarian too on the first day, however nothing great happened even on the remaining days. Apart from the bread and a here n there item..the veg section doesn't offer much. Not great buffet for vegetarians. Even the fruit platter remains ditto for 5 days... Only watermelon and pineapple were repeated.  My conclusion is that Indians and particularly vegetarians aren't much welcomed here. This place is meant for the Chinese, Koreans etc..  Any request to the housekeeping will take ages to address.  The upside of the hotel is it's location and the building. The pools are also nice and clean.  I'm not interested visiting this place again. RAJESH TEWARI wrote a review Oct 2017\n",

Awesome view of the sea. Whatever activity that we opted had a hotel pickup and drop. So commutation was not a problem plus if you wanna go to pattaya beach at any time then tuk-tuks are available round the clock.

      "40 D Varee Is Great, Will Be Back ! One of the best ever stayed hotel in Pattaya. This is the very first time we've tried Jomtien area and simply worth it. The hotel is big, right on the beach and far away from hustle & bustle of Pattaya. We're in 26th Floor @Deluxe Room. Room size was okay, nice balcony with sea view and provided basic toiletries, water and tea/ coffee making facilities are good and functioning. We've enjoyed both pools and hotel garden is simply peaceful. Menu of breakfast should be changed often otherwise everything was excellent. There're plenty of convenient stores, eating options exist and night market at Soi 7 is very nearby. For me it's a must try hotel in Pattaya and of course in Jomtien. We'll be back for sure and thanks to staffs of D Varee for keeping the property nice & welcoming. Shohagepyllion wrote a review Oct 2017\n",
      "50 5 Stars for the Beautiful View from Balcony D varee is by far the best Hotel at Jomtein beach.    Breathtaking view from balcony.    Although I didn't like Thailand much because of the thai people - taxi drivers, Song thaw drivers etc.. that try to kind of loot you. D varee was the place where I rather felt safe and could enjoy my 2 nights stay in Pattaya completely.    Rooftop restaurant: on 38th floor was amazing because of the view that it offers.. Happy hours from 6pm to 8 pm where you get BOGO on beer and cocktails    Room : was on 26th floor and it was neat and clean with all basic amenities, Electric kettel and tea coffee supplies and Android TV where I could play Youtube without any hassle. Thanks to the free wifi.  Furniture was a bit old and plain. But the beds were really comfortable. I had a good tight sleep.  And there are no words to describe the amazing feeling waking up to the view of sunrise over sea from your bed itself.    Washroom: were clean and with all basic toiletries.  Just to add you get view of sea while in front of bathroom mirror or while taking a shower.    In short no matter if you are in the room or washroom, you can view the sea from every nook and corner.    Buffet Breakfast: Although there were lot of options but didn't like it much.. They can have less number of items and ensure the ones on the buffet menu are tasty enough to satiate guest's pallete.    Kids play area: Great. Rides for kids and few coin goody dispensers    Pool : 2 pools one on ground and the other on 5th floor. Both were great. But the one on 5th floor offered spectacular views of the sea.    All in all,.of you happen to visit Pattaya and that too with a family, then stay at D Varee Jomtein beach as its away from the hustle bustle of Pattaya and is beautiful too samtraveldiaries wrote a review Sep 2017\n",

      "40 First Thai visit Helpful staff everywhere we turned. From arrival, through check-in, to helping settle in the room all the staff were eager to assist. Their English was generally okay for simple requests. More difficult questions like the best way to get to the Outlet Mall (4 or 5 km away) required some escalation. At breakfast, and around the pools the staff were always easy to find and service was given warmly.    Our room on the 25th floor gave great views to the west and north. The room furnishings are a bit dated and spartan with only one chair at the desk to sit on (other than the bed). There were no bedsides lamps and only one bedside table. The flooring appears to be a fake timber vinyl which obviously cleans well. The room very clean, with housekeeping finished most days before 11:30 am.    We really enjoyed the breakfast selection over our.3 day stay and never felt overcrowded despite the large number of guests. Breakfast buffets are spread over a number of rooms.    The pools were lovely and the perfect temperature for us. Again, a more simple style than say the over-stylised, landscaped gardens we've had in Bali. Didn't notice any chlorination but water was extremely clear.    As we were flying out on an evening flight, they kindly let us have a late check-out so we were able to enjoy our final day a bit longer. Jim W wrote a review Aug 2017\n",

Staff very friendly room service excellence and a overall 5 out of 5 rating. 68derickh wrote a review Aug 2017\n",
      "40 Would come back I'd def stay here again despite a few things that could be better.    It's at quieter end of Jomtien - 20mins to walk to Jomtien night market. Some say it's a bad thing but I personally don't like being amongst the crowds. If you like crowded areas completely full of Thais, Chinese etc then stay nearer the night market or over by Pattaya beach.    Also, to get to walking street on Pattaya it was just 20baht per person for the songtaws (small vans where you jump on the back with 15 others sat/hanging on there). Flag them down on the other side of the road (beachside) and just jump on the back. Pay when you get off. Walking street was about 20-25mins drive.    The lobby is grand with really good food,coffees and cakes at the lobby cafe.    Beach is just across the road.    2 pools. One on 5th floor was quieter.    Really good views from the balcony. We were given 23rd floor room facing the sea which was amazing for sunsets over the sea.    Room was clean. A lot of reviews say they're dated....they are a bit. The furniture is a bit old but who cares when it's clean, big comfy bed, clean bathroom with everything you need, big balcony with chairs to sit on and watch the sunsets. Air con is a little bit noisy but you've got problems if it's disturbing your experience. If you want Hilton-like features then go to a Hilton! A lot of people expect the earth in a cheaper hotel!    The breakfast selection is huge so you won't struggle with what to eat.    My only suggestions of advice to management reading this would be to reduce the amount of breakfast choices and make it a smaller, fresher, better looking selection rather than lots and lots of pots of food.    Also, we went to the bar on 38th floor to eat when we arrived on first evening but only food is tapas and seafood. Maybe have a few sandwich/burger/thai dish selections the same as you have in the lobby cafe. We were put off going up to 38th as the food selection was poor.    Overall though, if I/we come back to Pattaya I would recommend this hotel unless you prefer being in the middle of the noise, chaos, bars etc matthji wrote a review Aug 2017\n"

Pros: Right in front of the beach, great food, amazing club on the 38th floor, amazing restaurant by the beachfront.    Cons: Front Office staff is very unpleasing and very unwelcoming. One of my friends was trying to play the piano kept in the center of the lobby( without any banner) and the front office lady got so furious she was literally scolding me when I went to inquire her about something else( not cool at all). The bell boys are all the more rude.    The rooms- They look straight out of the 80's and so basic, that it is beyond explanation. Completely upsetting. Even the amenities placed are of a lower quality that a 3 star and has a very poor shower experience.    The only saviour was the food and DIB. So giving 4 points for the same. sonian953 wrote a review Aug 2017\n",

The staff were very helpful and friendly. Our room was on the 27th floor with a splendid view over the sea. The room itself was however a little tired and in need of decoration. The Air con dripped onto the floor and the balcony doors were no longer wind proof resulting in a rather loud howling noise when the wind got up. We would probably choose a smaller hotel next time.

The rooms were very spacious ,All we needed for our stay of 6 nights with Breakfast ,  The Breakfast buffet was fabulous and they had everything avaliable for all tastes ,The Staff were very attentive ,especially ,Fern and Katerina.  There are 2 swimming pools at the hotel however we found that the pool on the 5th floor was the pool of choice.  We did not have to go far to exprerience some really nice eateries at a decent price and local food ,all very tasty  Travel into Pattaya worked out really cheap at 40 Bhat for 4 of us ,However we found it easier to hire the Bhat bus back to hotel for an agreed price of 200 Bhat.  The Jet ski experience was just a short walk along the beach from the hotel and Again it is well worth trying to bring the initial price down a bit ,The Hosts for the Jet ski experience were very good and friendly.

The check-in time is 2:00 pm but we reached the hotel at 7:30 am and they allowed us to check-in early for some extra Bahts obviously. We got a room on the 28th floor with a mesmerising sea view from the balcony (sea is visible from all balconies, just the direction changes).  The hotel itself has all the facilities including two swimming pools, a gym for which they charge, restaurants with a rooftop bar on the 38th floor.  Breakfast was good, although not many options for vegetarians.  You will find many departmental stores, shops and restaurants just outside the hotel. The beach is just across the road.    If you are planning for a holiday in Pattaya, you can choose this Hotel and you won't regret it unless you have a lot to do at the walking street. Thats a bit far from the hotel.

Minor renovation is needed in some areas. There are 2 swimming pools. Both are clean and swim inviting. There are several restaurants on the hotel grounds. The sushi buffet in Dare restaurant is great. Breakfast on the 38 floor is a must. One has to try it even if it is not included in one's hotel rate. Try it. Worth every penny.  The rooms are spacious. With all need amenities. Air conditioning is very good. There are several elevators at the hotel, but it can get a bit crowded. Select if possible a higher floor as the view gets better.  The area around the hotel caters to one's needs. 7 eleven is next door as are foot massage parlour. The baht bus goes right in front of the hotel. 10 baht all the way to Jomtien.  If there is any problem you can contact Vera. She is very helpful and attentive. Will take care of all your needs.

Such a crowded area especially in the evening time, you would love the setting mix around with people. Need not stay inside the room without join the glorious pub and clubbing life, missed the most.

      "30 Good location, great views and pools I really liked being at the end of the Baht Bus route to experience a more quiet Jomtien. This hotel is big. Get a sea view room, the view is awesome. I also really enjoyed the swimming pool on the 5th floor. Not crowded, good view, refreshing water.    Everything here was good. But frankly the furniture was old and needed repair. No kitchen appliances. It was not as modern or nice as the pictures show on the website. But everything worked well.    There was a fire in the next room one morning. A bit scary. The staff put out the fire very promptly.    I had a bit of a hard time with the breakfast. Not much flavor and the food upset my stomach. I think it was the soups. I ended up going to a small coffee shop near the hotel instead and felt much better. I was traveling in the low season but expected a bit more activity in the rooftop night club. It truly is a great setting on the rooftop. Just no people were there. Karl S wrote a review May 2017\n",

Vera the Night Manager was so understanding of our situation and most days spoke to us about what weve been up to. She has been living in Thailand for 6 years so if unsure of anything just see her. Full buffet breakfast daily, 2 huge swimming pools, gymnasium, very friendly helpful staff. We would totally recommend this Hotel to anyone holidaying in, Jomtien, Pattaya.

Very reasonably priced, value for money. Also the staff are very friendly that made the stay more enjoyable.    I left my wrist watch in the room on the checked out date. I made a call to the hotel on the next day and knew that the maid found it and made a report to the supervisor. The hotel sent me back the watch in couple days. So impressed with all you guys did!

They recommended a nearby restaurant for dinner instead of just pushing the hotel restaurant which I actually liked it was a Japanese restaurant we had try later. Our deal was not include breakfast and room was booked without a sea view but the hotel offer a free upgrade to Sea View room and we paid for breakfast ,which was not expensive.  The hotel was nicely placed in Jomtien area, pretty quiet but there were a few nearby convenient store, bars and restaurants that we enjoyed trying.The room was large, tea making facilities were provided and even little slippers to wear post shower.

      "10 Poor service We got a very poor service from front desk when checking into the hotel. There were lots of customers (around 5-6 cases were served by staff and around 3 cases to wait for being served) and staff (around 8-10 people) at front desk; however, they cannot provide a queue for customers. Customers who came after other clients have been served before. For customers who did not raise it up would take around 20 minutes to be served. When checking in around 4pm, the room is unprepared, needed to wait for 30 minutes to get the room. Staff did not provide the standard details to us such as wifi password and where to have breakfast. We also got an extra bed in the room in the evening by not requiring and it found that it was sent to the wrong room, then they took it out at night. It can feel that the staff here are not well trained especially in providing wording to customers such as when they greeted us and firstly said how many minutes have you been booking for the room, we were surprised since we booked it at least a day in an advance and we found that the room was not ready for us.

I loved this hotel. Everything about it was good . The staff are super-friendly and very helpful - and all spoke English to acceptable level.  The room was delightful. I especially loved the balcony with a fantastic sea view - I find this is often a good indicator of a hotel's overall quality.  15 minutes to the center of the city.    I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place if you're planning a trip to Pattaya- great value too. lady421 wrote a review Apr 2017\n",

But what great views down the beach from the higher floors and at a budget price.  We were meeting friends in Jomtien so picked this hotel before our final stay in the small fishing village of Bangsaray.Bangsaray Villa was our final stay a 2 bed villa in a Great location not too far from the beach and a restfall spot away from the main Pattaya city.  we only had one night but it is worth a visit if you want Jomtien as your location,the beach near by is OK ,but we prefer the less touristy area of Bangsary just 25 mns away going towards Sattahip.The hotel has a nice Viewing area and bar on the high floor so great views from this locaton,This Hotel has undergone a new facelift which is a nice change from the old tired look Of Furama, 'Good Job' bangsarayvilla wrote a review Mar 2017\n",

      "40 Amazing View Stayed for three nights and enjoyed it. Had a room at the 23rd floor with an amazing view from the small balcony. The room a bit worn down but clean and with a comfortable bed. A large window makes it possible to enjoy the view from the bathtub. Shades can be applied if it makes you uncomfortable. Had complimentary cocktails at the rooftop bar every evening. A great way to watch the sunset.  The hotel has two pools. Unfortunately the few sun chairs was occupied from the morning most days, so get up early if that is your thing. Otherwise the beach is just across the street.  Jomtien is much more quiet than Pattaya so I would recommend it for couples traveling with kids or simply people just fed up with the hustle and bustle in Pattaya.

      "30 Pictures arent always what they seem I recently stayed here for Christmas and New Year in total 18 nights so I got a good idea of what the hotel is really like, fitrst of all we upgraded to suite as the rooms were small and shabby needed painting and updating.The suite was ver nice and spacious but this also was shabby in parts rust on the mirrors scratches and marks on the floor, and shower curtain and towels had seen better days, the view from the balcony was amazing but yet again needed painting it was shabby.    Now I must come to the important part the staff were a disgrace they were lazy unhelpful and not pleasant, I have been to Thailand many times and have never come a cross staff like this.I had club benefits each morning at breakfast the staff just wondered around did not ask us if we wanted tea or coffee and the tables didnt get cleaned even when there was no one at breakfast they just stood around I blame the management they were just as bad.    The 38th floor was a joke it was a great view but yet again staff just ignored you and when you asked for a drink they looked like they could not be bothered and never brought what you asked for our friends waited 30 mins one night for a drink then they were just rude we complained to the young manager who just laughed in my face he didn't care.    As for the pool area well the 5th floor was nice but the sun loungers and umbrellas had seen better days they were cracked and spilt and umbrellas were broken, so I went to the ground floor pool which seemed ok on the surface but there was a constant stench of sewage so it was unbearable to lie there.I went to the beach alot which was not a nice white sandy beach outside the hotel you get your towels at reception one day they had none so told me I had to go to the pool area for them this was not good service there were 3 people standing doing nothing could they not get them for me when I asked they said no and laughed in my face yet again.    I have never come across such bad service you would not get this at the Amari or Dusit the D varee needs to get there staff trained in manners and i must name one in particular Supatrra she was so lazy she would do anything but her job..I would not recommend this hotel for more than 2 nights and its definatley not 4 star the balconys are all cracked and look unsafe.

The rooms were spacious and clean, but a bit dated. The buffet breakfast is very good and has everything from the traditional bacon and eggs to pasta and rice and noodles! The beach is clean and quiet for those who wish to relax by the waves.    The hotel has 2 great swimming pools and a poolside bar. The rooftop Inspiration bar on the top floor has great views of the ocean and city but it was quite deserted when we were there.

We have gone on several short trips and Jeeralees and Supawadee at the front desk have been very efficient and helpful every time we have checked in. I have met several people at this hotel who have moved here from other resorts on Jomtien Beach at the recommendation of others and they have all told the same story.

They where also about to change the prices on the breakfastbuffet and made us pay 650 bat when later we saw a sign that it was 450 bat. We did get the money back but still felt a bit played..    The pool area is great! They have to big pools it's clean and nice ! The rooms are really big and the beds are comfortable. They do need to take new pictures for there homepage though, the rooms are outdated.    We might have became a bit spoiled at our trip because all the hotels/hostels we stayed in sour east Asia where so helpful.

The internet kept disconnecting in our room so we were having trouble booking bus tickets to go back to Bangkok. The hotel does not have a business center which I thought was weird for a hotel like this and they were not helpful with getting us access to one even when we asked for an internet cafe close by.

We stayed at a Executive Suite located on the 16.th.floor with some 80m2 Space. The first room that one enters to had a Kitchen, but no Equipment for using it. But it had a large rerfigerator, a dining table with 4 Chairs, sofa and a small coffetable and a ordinary extra bed. In the bedroom it had spacious wardrobes, separate aircondition in the two rooms and one tv-set in each room. It also had dvd player, but only for zone 3, so it couldn't be used unless you had dvd from Asia.    The bathroom was ok, but the Place to Wash, brush teeth and so on, was very low, reaching us only to the thighs. Also the bathroom, as many other Places in the hotel, had a 5-6 cm different height in the room. It made us stumble lots of times, even into the room, at the outdoor bar on the topfloor and so on.    Both rooms in the suite had gliding doors to enter to the large balcony, but quite noisy because two airconditions outside.    The hotel had two ATMs beside the reception, a cakeshop, indoor and outdoor bar on top of the hotel and two swimmingpools with Cold water.    The Spa was only open for reservations and took Place only behind a screen, as far as we could see.    On the seaside of the hotel, devided by the mainstreet, there was a restaurant/bar with live Music, sometimes.    Along the beachroad there is many small and big restaurants, also located in nearby hotels.    You could not use American Express to pay in the hotel, but Diners Club.    Breakfast was not included, but we bought it extra and has breakfast on the 5.th.floor. Very ordinary breakfast and the omelets tasted bad because they used the same fryingoil over and over again.    Maybe a idea to put up a sign that mobiephone should not be used in the breakfastroom ?    Transportation to Pattaya was by either tuk tuk, 10 baht each persons or with the yellow taxi at 300-400 baht.    The main negative thing about the hotel is that the mainstreet devides the hotel and the Beach. Second negative is not very much maintenance of the rooms. The hotel looks old and a bit overprized considered it's quality. Also you had to pay for using the gym!    The positive is two swimmingpools, two ATMs and a variety of restaurant in the hotelarea. The room was clean and so was the bathroom.    We used the hotel as starting Place for travel around. It's easy to rent a car from the nearby Hertz and it's cheap.

      "30 Just okay It in center of Jomtien beach. The room is quite old. The pictures might took at their opening first year. Air conditioning is old and not cool. Staff is friendly and helpful. Rooftop bar is nice and excellent. Itz Me J wrote a review Dec 2016\n",
      "50 Affordable with classic amenities I stayed at 17th floor and it was quiet. Excellent seaview room! You can try swimming pool at fifth and ground floor. Breakfast buffet is simply awesome! Room service is good. Tuk tuk to walking street costs around 10 baht. Place is in jomtien beach with relatively mild crowd. Wifi is good. . Only negative is the furniture needs repairs or renovation. Overall with a tight budget the facility provided is excellent! Shresthanjan Nath wrote a review Dec 2016\n",
      "40 Nice View with Reasonable Price My family stayed at this hotel and it was good experience. The location was excellent as it was a few steps to the beach (I mean across the street). The service was good for the price..we had a good deal since we stayed there for three nights. I am just not sure about the breakfast as we didn't choose the option. It was easy to find places to sell food and had breakfast on the Jomitien Beach. amitsuraraj wrote a review Dec 2016\n",
      "50 Very nice hotel with awesome view! I stayed in this hotel before and I was happy to back here again. I think this is the best hotel in Jomtien area. Location is good, not far from city center (abiut 20 min drive) and very close to beach. There are many 7/11 shops and etc. around. Public transport is 24/7. I also like 2 swimming pools, bar on the top (38 floor), and rooms have balcony with beautiful sea view! Breakfast, service and cleaning were good. But most of all enjoyed live music in their beach restaurant \"Dee beach\". Honestly I have nothing to complain about! Katerina wrote a review Nov 2016\n",

      "50 Fantastic location and the Hotel that has everything Well I never really knew what to expect after reading quite mixed reviews but overall really enjoyed my stay at D'Varee. The check in people were very friendly when we arrived after a long flight. we were upgraded to a sea view which was a nice touch. The rooms were fine, beds stripped daily, water stocked up in fridge daily.  The roof top bar was fantastic but over priced. That was the only downside to the Hotel. The staff were all friendly and accommodating even when I left my passport in a taxi when going home. I phoned the hotel and they tracked down the taxi and got the driver to take it back to the airport where I was stranded.  Definitely booking again for next year again, the hotels pool on the 5th floor to the friendliness of the staff was fantastic. even the guys who greeted you or helped you across the road were exceptionally polite and friendly Iain N wrote a review Nov 2016\n",

When we got the room, it is very disappointed because the room is very old and smell is very bad. Moreover, air conditioner is not working, and still need to wait for maintenance says about half hour.    From all of terrible experiences, not even say a word \"Sorry\" from the hotel.

Pity is that all the tables and sits in the common parts are totally dirty in order not to say nondelig.  The dirt is only distributed on the Tableglass not taken away.  In the breakfast room the glass panes are cloudy, if you touch them you have to wash the hands, you can see the accumulated dirt through the glass panes of the tables.  In the restaurant, which is by the way, very nice and good, the tables are so filthy that you have to wash your arms and hands after sitting.

It is located in a very beautiful area that is Jomtien Beach, a lovely place, nice beach... it has everything but life is more tranquil and relaxing. It is about 10 kilometers far from Pattaya downtown, but well connected through local public transport.    I like the architecture of the tower, one of the tallest of the area, so highest levels get a wonderful view. In the first level you find many things such restaurants, pool, gym and even music in the evening. The rooms are big, comfortable, affordable... I recommend online reservations through Tripadvisory.    At the top of the tower there is a nice bar. Albeiror24 wrote a review Oct 2016\n",

Myself, wife, twin 2 year old babies and 80 year old father had to wait 90 mins to get allocated a room - how long does it take to clean 2 rooms?    When discussing the issue at the reception desk the lady just walked away and started to talk to another guest - how rude !    During our wait (in the lobby cafe) they even managed to mis-calculate the bill and came back to ask for more money.    This hotel whilst looking great on the website and outside is actually old and shabby. Its over run with Chinese tourists and breakfast is a shambles.    Unprofessional.

We had family room which was spacious . 1 qn and 1 kg . and had their own private bathroom.  Staffs are very nice and polite, expecially NANA , She goes above and beyond expectation, Honest , and willing to help you research to contact tour ,activity, boat rental ,etc with no pressure or commission involve. Any problem ? She take care of it immediately.( We love you Ms.Nana. 2 thumbs up for you)    Con:All Mattresses were so hard ,the sofa much comfier and end up I had to sleep there.  Lots of ants will come if you have sweet stuffs on the counter.  Buffet breakfast was tasty , only one thing need to be improve was the noodle station, staff pick up food to your dish with bare hand , NO GLOVES.

      "50 Great place to come and relax When we first arrived things did not get off to a great start problems with the room and a leaky aircon unit however the next morning i went to reception and met Vera Byankina, all things changed she listened to my comments and then sorted everything out ! We were moved to a stunning room in the centre of the hotel with a huge balcony. My jacket that the air con got damp was dry cleaned and the new room resolved all other problems.  Vera is clearly a star on reception and a fantastic Guest Service Manager, and great Ambassador for this hotel and its high standards  We too the club option paying a little more for this but its well worth it breakfast was included the first few days in the dining room by the pool but due to a air conditioning replacement the breakfast moved to D.I.B. wow what a venue, it should be up there all the time quiet relaxed with great vistas over Jomtien Beach, please when we come back, and we will be back don't move it back to the bottom of the hotel ! We were served most days by the same two ladies and as my partner had to work were were there as they opened at 6 most mornings, after day one they knew exactly what we wanted and whilst we chose our food ours coffees were made with out needing to ask it was a really pleasure to be served by Ms Paeng and Ms Gig as they made our rush about in the morning very easy with their professional manner and help.  The breakfast selection was great but they don't do the healthy white egg option that my partner likes so he showed the chef Mr Arm what he wished for and the chef made white egg omelettes and scrambled whites for him every day, Please add this to your egg menu.  The evening D.I.B. staff were also great remembering what i like to drink from day two just one comment to make here there is no point serving a quarter measure of wine or one mouth full and its gone but i did keep your ladies busy keeping up.  House Keeping was another triumph my partner got sick and did not get up one day until 6pm when he felt better. i was asked to let house keeping know when we were out and even though we were so late they did the most fantastic job. I have never seen a room get such a thorough going over everything was moved and cleaned, Ms Sunee and Mr Boonyaluk are exceptional at their work and a credit to this hotel.  One Bad comment i may make but its not the fault of the hotel but does need sorting is the need of some of the guests from china to spit into the swimming pool this was disgusting and there in no excuse if you are a civilised human go to the facilities they are close ! I see other hotels clearly state they have a zero tolerance of this and boot them out of the pool area.  it may also be a nice idea to keep the under 16s in the large family style pool so the noise is in one area :)  I love this hotel and we will come back for sure Thank you for a wonderful stay thomas1972NZ wrote a review Sep 2016\n",

Firstly the majority of the food is barely warm or cold , it is placed in serving pans with never working heaters below it, and worst of all the lids if there at all are open to the environment, not healthy at all.  i kept looking enviously at the other dinning room that i could not access they must have had hot food.  one morning I arrived no cutlery no cups and no glasses and nowhere to sit , plenty of empty chairs but 90% of the tables had plates and leftover food on them .  another morning no forks , tried the then cold potato Au gratin it was very under cooked.  I have viewed the other reviews saying similar things with the managers response saying they have looked at the situation and will be improving it , no they haven't, so i do not believe in the comments, they are just empty promises .  I did book to come again with my wife , sorry no way, cancelled .  I will never get the chance to see the improvements ? russellh731 wrote a review Aug 2016\n",

When the rain winds, the windows vibrate loudly, it makes us scared. The most disappointing thing is when having breakfast , meals were not given the text , when I asked what it was halal food they answer yes , I 've been eating the meat , it was pork . I am a Muslim is forbidden to eat pork . Supposedly every text given food and staff stand by in food stand . I was very disappointed with the service here . I will never stay again in this hotel .

The coffee (Illy, therefore good) arrived promptly, as did the sandwich. Our breakfasts, however, took 45 minutes to appear. We were the only customers. When I commented to the manageress (in Thai) that we had waited 45 minutes she did not appear interested and no attempt was made to apologise.

      "30 In Dire Need of Refurbishment Jomtien Beach offers affordable accommodation compared to Pattaya Beach and mostly are decade old hotels which had seen better days and this hotel is one of it. It used to be known as Furama Jomtien and may be one of the best hotel there 20 years ago but the current state of the hotel leaves much to be desired and in dire need of refurbishment. I booked the standard room and the first thing that caught my attention was the room reeked of old furniture smell. The room itself is quite spacious with a kitchenette but other than that it was bare minimum. You could see most of the furniture could have been used since the hotel was opened 20 years ago and never replaced nor touched up. The only part of the room which i believe had been renovated is the tiling in the bathroom. The balcony is the only winning point of the room as it provides expansive view of the sea. The room was also dimly lit with one very dusty table lamp by the bedside. It can be quite scary if you live alone in this room to state frankly.    Another positive point for this hotel is the buffet breakfast. There are many choices to choose from and suitable for vegetarian as well. The breakfast area is spacious but again spartan with minimal decoration which looks almost like roadside eatery. The main pool is located outside of the breakfast area as well as there's a gym.    For the price paid i really cant complain much but will also not consider this hotel as the best option to stay as it was not really a comfortable stay being surrounded by gloomy archaic furniture and fittings of the hotel. I noted that guest rooms are available only up to 20th floor and the remaining floors above were left vacant which also contributed to an eerie feeling. I believe local handyman can do the retouching-repainting and small refurbishment in the hotel which only will involve minimal cost at least the guest can have a comfortable stay in a refurbished room.    The wifi signal was good and the staffs are generally friendly. However i had to make 5 calls to get an iron and they were quite strict on their check out time by reminding us of the same but forgetting the fact that we were waiting for the iron, if it had arrived earlier we could have checked out way before the check out time.    I believe this hotel has good facilities which need to be revamped and refurbished to keep up with time to ensure customers comfort. Apart from the beautiful view out of the balcony nothing memorable was derived from my stay at this hotel. KayTon83 wrote a review Jul 2016\n"

Good staff and service and also four star for the facilities. But please control the tour groups, e.g., for Breakfast buffet, the hotel should arrange it separate from other guests.

      "50 rejuvitation! Davree  I just stayed 10 days here in Pattaya. It was a wonderful relaxing trip! I usually research a bit since I do not stay only 1 or 2 days. I am extremely happy with my stay and I am planning to go back soon. In the next 30 days but stay 2 weeks this time. The whole experience was wonderful.  I had a few small problems, but Vera was an absolute dream to take care of me! Like the first room the hot water was not working. So she moved me to a new room and went with me to check the hot water to make sure it was to my satisfaction! Since I have no bathtub here in my home in Thailand. I was really looking forward to the hot baths!! So I made sure to get a nice bathtub!!  I would highly recommend staying at the Dvaree in Pattaya! I will soon return and work on a time to enjoy and relax! As well I recommend for you to get the breakfast on the 5th floor well worth it!! Wonderful!  Hope this helps!  See you on my return!

      "30 Pay to much for taxis Beautiful hotel with fabulous sea views. The only down side is the staff try to screw you with taxis, all taxis the hotel get for you are way over priced. You are better of going out the back of the hotel and hailing a tuc tuc on the street. Sad to think you pay good money for a hotel for it to be let down by the bell hop staff.

      "30 Good Hotel for price Hotel is good with respect to price but it looks tired and attention to detail is missing. Breakfast was the only highlight of this establishment with lots of choices. Location is good as there is no hustle bustle on the front beach facing area unlike pattaya walking street (if you are looking for privacy and silence).  The down side was that no Halal food was available in lunch and dinner menu, we have to walk around 1.5 kms to find Fatima Restaurant and also there was a stand with Shawarma serving Halal food.  Pool is ok and has lots of Chinese people everywhere. Overall an average place to stay. Sarwar H wrote a review Jun 2016\n",

Good amenities. Better tea and coffee. Prompt check in. Staff with a smile very friendly. Thats what one looks for. But it was rain that's why every wet, any way it not a big deal!

      "40 Good hotel with amazing views! We stayed on the higher floor with our balcony facing the front view. It's breath taking! Absolutely loved it.  The room was modern with a good, big bed and a clean bathroom. Daily housekeeping did a wonderful job every day, even when we got sick and didn't want to be disturbed she still took care if we had enough water and toilet paper.    The location of the hotel was absolutely perfect for us. Located on a quiet side of Jomtien beach but still with plenty bars, restaraunts and markets around. Pattaya center is just 15 minutes away with a \"tuk tuk\" that passes by very often and until late.    Both pools of the hotel were very pleasant but in need of more umbrellas! Not possible to be under the sun the whole day!  Prices were typicaly more expensive than outside but it was very convenient to have the drinks service by the pool.    Tried to go one evening to the top floor bar but it was just too empty which is a pity because it would be great to have a night out so high up with an amazing night view of Jomtien.    Overall, we had a wonderful stay at your hotel! Thank you!! Annuta P wrote a review May 2016\n",
      "10 Feral This hotel easily takes the cake for the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. (5 gruelling days)    Pros:  - Friendly/helpful outside security staff    Cons:  - Filthy & unmaintained. There was rust everywhere in the bathroom, splashes of brown substance on the door and walls, mould throughout the shower & on curtain, mosquitoes emanating from the drains, no exhaust fan. Bathroom had very obviously had not been cleaned properly in a long time.  - Shower broke twice throughout our stay.. fixed first time after 3 repair requests face-to-face at reception, lasted a day & then broke again. Had to hand hold the shower head throughout the duration of our showers.  - Wireless internet down two of our five day stay. Phoned reception the second time to enquire as to why and when it would be rectified & was responded to with \"yes it's broken & don't know when fix\" and hung up on.  - Horribly rude reception staff, further to above.  - No furniture what so ever on courtyard which was at least 2 metres squared. Such a waste of space. Air-conditioning compressor not wall mounted (sitting on ground with cables exposed) & blows hot air straight across the back door wall.  - It is in the middle of nowhere & walking distance to Jomtien Beach only.  -room service food took 2 reminder phone calls & approx 1 hour to arrive at our room.    We would never stay here again & highly recommend that others do not. So much room for improvement at D Varee. Erin M wrote a review May 2016\n",
      "40 Decent hotel I was staying at the hotel for 2 nights. The hotel receptionists have limited command of English but still able to communicate. We were told our room was not ready when we checked in at 12 midnight. It was very strange. We booked a king size bed but when we entered the room, we were offered 2 single beds jointed together with a king size bedsheet. Beside that, the room  was cozy and clean. Comfortable bed, clean toilet and strong wifi. The breakfast was a spread. The rooftop bar has a magnificent view and definitely worth going up. The balcony view was equally amazing. Hotel location was ok. Will definitely go back again. tsf_tan87 wrote a review May 2016\n"

      "30 OK Nice hotel and kept clean , comfortable beds, shower and bath wasn't upto much . staff friendly , the elevator took some working out, each 1 going to different floors almost so you seemed to be going up and down to get somewhere and they were very slow and very stuffy. Very busy with Japanese and Indians,there needs seem to be catered for most at breakfast. Wifi not very good and we had one of the pools closed , which we did not get informed when we booked it only the day before our arrival . Location ok if you don't want to be in the thick of it as not much around but you can easily get a tuc tuc outside . Becky164 wrote a review May 2016\n",
      "30 Needs improvement in service Pattaya was a one night stay during our visit to Thailand. We arrived at the hotel in the afternoon. Check is was smooth and we were given the rooms immediately. We booked a deluxe ocean view room on the 28th floor and the view was magnificent. However, the room interior is not as great as it's displayed on online channels. It was very old and tired looking. Hot water did not work and the bath tub did not drain . We informed this to the front desk and they took more than an hour to attend to it. At the check in they give you a coupon for a welcome drink which we have to claim by going to the rooftop bar. It's just one plain apple juice. Personally I think it's a waste of time and rightfully the welcome drink should be given as and when you arrive at the hotel. No one would want to go all the way up to a rooftop bar to have an apple juice!! Food was reasonably okay but the buffet spread was all over the place. There were no direction boards and the service staff do not know the basic table etiquette. When you leave your cutlery and go for the second serving they take all your plates and cutlery out. Quite disappointing for a large hotel who has been in service for a long time. Also the staff hardly speaks in English ,therefore you need to have a google translator saved on your phone all the time. View and the location is good , but not very close to attractions like walking street , pattaya floating market and pattaya downtown. It's right opposite jomtien beach.

      "50 A great property and wonderful hospitality I read through a lot of mixed reviews for D varee and we consider this hotel to have given one of the best stay while we were at Thailand.  We were here between 15 th and 18 th April 2016. Rooms are great with all required amenities, hospitality is nice and the view was amazing.  We reached here at around 8 Am & official check in was at 2 Pm. We requested the front desk for an early check in and they agreed at 11 as the rooms were booked due to thr new year festival. While we waited, a beautiful and charming hotel manager - Vera Byankina approached us and gave us a free upgrade as we were with our 3 year old baby. She checked us in immediately at around 9 Am and did everything a great manager should do. Vera changed our over all experience to wow.  They have swimming pools at ground and 1st floor which is amazing . View from the balcony and room is serene and outstanding. They have an evening live band headed by beautiful Yorkee.  Thru have a huge gala breakfast everyday, however, we faced some problems with the food. Beef , pork and chicken is cooked together which would definitely be an issue with Indians and muslim guests. Aldo food is not halal and they should take care of this.  Over all a great stay.    Thanks Vera and team. This is a great place to be at. FaizanNKhan wrote a review Apr 2016\n",

      "40 Very clean, very friendly staff The hotel is huge. The amenities are very good.  They have a fantastic buffet breakfast that's a little confusing at first.  But there is ample food choices plus open air dining and alacarte style eggs / omelettes.    I was on the 29 the floor. The views are spectacular.  Bookings seem to be run of house, so you will always get a room equal to, if not better than the booking.    Down a little bit in Jomtien, Soi 10 area, but the baht bus goes all the way from Pattaya to here for 10 baht. Unreal.    The pool is huge, and a good depth.  I am 183 cm and cannot stand on the bottom.  Bar facilities and swim up areas pool side are good.    All in all, a good hotel. Look for the specials. David A wrote a review Apr 2016\n",
      "20 Left a bitter taste We stayed in this venue for 10 nights in April 2016. Location is great, views from the bar on the top floor are impressive! Plenty to do locally, restaurants, bars, water parks etc etc. The room we stayed in was an \"executive room\"....executive it was not! It was merely a standard room with executive club benefits.  Included in the room type was drinksand snacks in the DIB bar on the 38th floor. We have stayed in many hotels which offer an executive club, but never one so poorly operated. If you book and use the bar be prepared to wait some time to have an order taken, then a good while longer to get a drink, that's if they can be bothered to serve you! The snack they offer is generally something thrown together from the breakfast leftovers, then a small plate of fruit.  Generally the staff in the restaurant are poorly trained, lack communication skills and do not not their job.  All these points I raised with a member of the reception staff, she merely nodded ans smiled in all the right places but can't imagine anything will change there for the foreseeable future.  Final day, bags packed, checked out. Just about to walk out of the hotel and was called back as we hadn't paid all the bill! We had an outstanding bill.....for a broken glass! I cod not believe I had to pay for a glass that had been broken. So after 10 generally pleasant nights, this is our final goodbye from this hotel........not a very pleasant one!!  Thanks D'varee, thanks a lot 😡  p.s. This hotel is a overnight stop over for Chinese coach tours, so late afternoon and early morning the place is like Shanghai train station.

      "10 Not worthy of a 4 star rating Hotel at its most basic level is perfectly fine. This hotel is not worth the price of what you're paying in addition to the amount of surcharges they will knowingly hold you responsible for. Family friendly near an average beach. Very nice beds and a beautiful view. Hotel food is very expensive compared to average prices in general. We skipped the breakfast due to sanitation comments. Hotel is remote in comparison to the main strip of the Pattaya Beach front and walking street. It is simply not worth the money. I do not recommend. Liz R wrote a review Apr 2016\n",

      "20 From a dream to a nightmare My wife, 6 year old daughter and I went to Jomtein and stayed at D Varee. The location is fantastic and staff very friendly. We were upgraded to a room with better view and the access to the beach was very convenient. We were scheduled to stay for four days three nights. Our nightmare started on the third day when we had breakfast at the hotel, as it was very hot we decided to rest in our room, about three hours after breakfast my daughter started vomiting, followed by extreme stomach pain and now the same is being felt by my wife. We rushed her to the Bangkok Hospital Pattaya, where we remain now. I have informed Nana, D Varee Hotel Duty Manager and await actions from them. Avoid uncooked food and bakery items.

Second surprise, at snack bar downstairs, our kid broke accidentally a glass of wine and we have been charged 200 THB !.....not really professional and friendly.Finally we've discovered that Thai people got more than 50% discount for the room, the reason why place is noisy and some customers with really bad habits! Finally, the room was ok but old with an extraordinary view on Jomtien beach. Jean-Paul M wrote a review Apr 2016\n"

      "30 Family stay I stayed with my family in the 2 bedroom suite. We booked ocean facing 1 bedroom suite but got upgraded as they allotted our room to another guest that probably wanted the ocean view. This particular corner 2 bedroom suite number 2401 is very large and excellent on the inside with a partial ocean view but as you step out of the room it has some foul drain type smell. I guess all corner rooms may have the same foul smell. The room has neither a Micro or stove or plates, etc. The noon check in process took too long and the service sloppy with most employees not knowing English.  The welcome drink coupon was a farce with few sips of apple juice in a small plastic disposable glass. Guess they lured you to the rooftop bar for this welcome drink so that you buy other stuff. The rooftop pool was great with an excellent unobstructed ocean view. The open air bar and restaurant at the entrance has a live band every night after 8 PM.  Has buffet breakfast with a wide variety of western breakfast and Thai lunch in an indoor and outdoor setting. Some breakfast items were average tasting but the coffee was tasteless and the bacon rubbery.  The Jomtien beach location is quiet as it is a few minutes cab drive to Pattaya.

View was great. Our suite had 3 varandah and all were with great view. Two had mighty ocean viewed. This suite had a separate kitchen. But no micro-oven was there. But It is supposed to be there. Our children enjoyed their stay very much. Their room service, free in-room-internet, roof-top drinks, breakfast all were very good. They prepared our dinner as we ordered(They prepared it with no-egg, no-beef, no-chicken, no-seafood as we are vegan). As a whole it was a very nice stay, mainly for children. There is no Indian restaurant at near by walking area. I wish to come back here again for pleasant staying. hasom2014 wrote a review Mar 2016\n",

The rooms on the high floor 20th and up are delux type , too high , too scary for altitude sickness-typed person. Not recommended for family with small childrens, it's dangerous on the corridor with such a low height of fence. The beach at front of the hotel is dirty and there is a pier for Jetskiis, and concrete blocks left there , look messy. The meeting room is very big and spacious , quite good for company meeting and night party.

      "30 Decent views, average hotel. Four of us booked 2 rooms for one night here.    Briefly, the highlights of the hotel are the decent seaviews which we got from the 27th floor, the view from the 5th floor pool, and also nice views from the sky bar.    The rooms were pretty average. I believe that the hotel is 11 years old and it shows. We could see evidence of crumbling balconies, gaps in the floor with ants crawling around and as others have mentioned there are some very dated looking TVs with a poor signal. The air-conditioning is very noisy and probably needs a good clean.    At breakfast time you can skip the main dining area where the place is packed with tour groups and head to the alternative dining area on the left which was much less packed, had plenty of available seating and was much quieter in general as it was mostly filled with Thai families rather than rowdy Chinese tour groups.    The hotel is right next to the beach road making for a convenient location. The beach is nothing to write home about and the sea is a murky colour. However, neither of these things are the hotel's fault.    There is plenty of choice of decent Thai restaurants within walking distance offering much better value and tastes than the food served at the sky bar at the hotel. Do go up to the 38th floor for a drink to watch the sun set, but don't be tempted by the over priced and poor quality of food on a limited menu up there.    I would say this hotel is OK for families. The area is not too seedy compared to Pattaya, but for beach and a swim in the sea, you will be far better off going to Rayong or Hua Hin if you don't have time to fly to the nicer beaches in southern Thailand.    Thumbs up for the Thai staff at this hotel. They seemed to be mostly cheery, happy and helpful, even when having to deal with demanding tour groups. Scott wrote a review Mar 2016\n",
      "30 Lovely Views First impressions of the hotel was the dust on the wooden furniture at reception. I did point this out to staff and it was cleaned right away. The deluxe room was small and tired but comfortable. I am not sure about this trend to have open plan bathrooms....I really don't relish the idea of sharing my companions toilet moments through a glass window. Although you can pull the shower curtain across for privacy.  The pools were nice, the only downside being that there was a conference near to the ground floor pool; so all you could hear was the noise of their speakers.  The beers and wines and cocktail snacks on the 37th floor was a highlight (benefit of upgrading the room) however we did have to ask them to turn down the loud dance music that somewhat spoiled the atmosphere.  The views however were stunning.  Overall good value for money and a pleasant experience Alex9Maputo wrote a review Mar 2016\n",

Beautifull hotel with all you can ask for. Great breakfast [ fresh egg + more station ] 2 nice pools , wifi in the rooms and lobby but not at the pools.  It is a little out of the erea were the restaurants are it is on soy 14 [ they have one and there are 3/4 options next to it ] but 7 minutes in the 10 bath pick-up and you are at soy 2 to 7 were lots of shops restaurants and bars are situated.  My biggest minus is that while the hotel looks realy great the room we stayed [ deluxe upgrade by the hotel 2617 ] was very dated and realy need a big pimp-up.It was spacious and clean ; but in need of new paint and bathroom refurbishment  [ moldy paintless looking > but clean ! ]. A real bad thing was the FREE drink in the beautifull toproofbar [ 38th floor ] > a apple juice with soda : as a hotel like that you HAVE to do a little better and show what you can expect when you visit the bar while you stay [ maybe stupid we did not go back to bar because of the ... offered drink ].  Last thing : realy nice hotel but for older people : for everything you have to walk some distances > to the pools / all different breakfast stations. Big +++ when you book better rooms you also can get upmarket breakfast in a smaller more private seperate erea [ very good thinking. One piont for the management : when you keep on working with one day Chinees guests > please consider to use a seperate erea from the hotel for them. Because they are [ different / unsocial ] very noisy on the hallways and love to smash there doors when they arrive and go [ all together ] for breakfast. You upgraded us just inbetween all this one-night guests and i think that was not fiar. We had an good stay for very good price and will visit again. foodlover1967 wrote a review Mar 2016\n"

On of the housekeeping staff was very helpful and she was the only one we met. The worst part of this stay is breakfast experience. We went to have breakfast about at 9 am, a lot of items were cold, especially soups station which I didn't see any heating equipment. Cups for juices were so dirty, and even worse when I asked them to replace dirty cups with cleaned one, their staff says that are what we have with a very unpleasant reaction. So we didn't drink even a water during the breakfast.

Had staff that don't just watch TV and take selfies and stand around doing nothing. As a result we left early.    Don't reply with your generic I'm sorry letter because we know you won't improve anything. Get better service from the night market. Mikey wrote a review Jan 2016\n",
      "30 Great view with average food We stayed here for 2 nights and the hotel's location is excellent. Our room was on the 18th floor with balcony overlooking the sea. The breakfast was pretty average but service was good. Not recommended for food at the given price. There are many good restaurants nearby along the beach.

      "50 Rooms with a fantastic view I have stayed at this property for 3 nights in the early December. Stay was really good and hassle free. Following are some positives and negatives of this property:    Positives:    1. Location: Right opposite the sea. There is only a public road between sea and the hotel.    2. View: Superb sea facing view.    3. Huge breakfast: Its huuuuggge and covers multiple cuisine types.    4. Swimming pools: Strategically placed, especially the 5th floor pool.    5. Friendly staff: All the bell boys, housekeeping staff and reception staff is very friendly. Special thanks to Nana, Vera Byankina and another male person (forgot his nane). Especially Vera is quite informed and saved my 2 hours when I was travelling to Bangkok.    Negatives:    Stinking elevators: Elevators next to reception didn't have fan and it was stinking especially during the afternoon. SagarRahurkar wrote a review Dec 2015\n",
      "10 Way too expensive Let me be clear, I did not stay in this hotel because I had my doubts after reading the comments on tripadvisor. But after dinner close byn i wanted to have a drink at the terrace, there was a band playing and i thought this coud be nice. BUT : service ws sooooo bad ! i had to wait for ten minutes before a girl came to take my order, then another 10 minutes for my wihite wine, i asked for an ashtray, didn t get one. The bill : 350 bath !!!!! i don t pay this in Belgium for a glass a white wine ! I will never come back to this place ... There are,much nicer places for 1/3 of the price and nice and polite staff !

      "30 Value for money Location  The hotel is located just beside the beach, far from the crowded area.  Quite peaceful if you are planning to enjoy the vacation.  On the hindsight, it's good to include the transport cost since cabbing around is a must if you plan to travel around pattaya.    Amenities  I am amazed by the Dvaree Inspiration Bar at the top floor.  The concept of flourescent menu is interesting.  Ambience is perfect. Music is great.    Service  Customer service was great(Maybe due to the upgrade they gave me :) )  On the bad side, my room key was deactivated everyday and I need to make a uturn back to the CS to tell them this problem after a long day. I stayed for 4days 3 nights. Ching S wrote a review Dec 2015\n",

      "30 Reasonably priced 4* hotel but looking really tired Stayed for 3 nights and booked for a Superior Sea View but was upgraded to a Deluxe Sea View which was appreciated. The hotel is very big with lots of rooms and close to 40 stories high which is very tall amongst the other buildings in Jomtien. I do believe this was another hotel before it was bought over by the D Varee group.    The hotel is advertised as 4 star and luxury but I do not feel this is accurate. The lobby is large and modern. Staff are not so friendly but they get the job done. The Rooms have great views (I was on the 29th Floor) but the rooms are very spartan with dated furnishing. Lighting is not sufficient thus room is dark in the night and Balcony was great but the air conditioning condenser was placed there too, so you will be hearing that thing and blowing hot air at you when u are enjoying your view unless u turn off the air conditioning in the room. Bathroom has been upgraded abit but shower head would not stay up and even using the curtains, water would leak out making the bathroom wet all the time.    The light switch for the room, whilst turning off/on the lights also turns off the socket for power next to the bed. This means u cannot charge your phone next to your bed when lights are off and have to do it at the desk which is really quite inconvienent. I have never seen that before in any hotel I have stayed in. What was also not convenient was the internet was not free in the rooms and u have to pay for it.    Breakfast was a good spread of lots of food both Thai and American and available from 6 to 10am. All in all a decent stay but they need to start upgrading the rooms.

      "30 Fantastic View I am giving this a 3 star rating because they have a fantastic view and staff were very friendly and helpful. However it was not a Deluxe stay. The rooms are in need of an upgrade if they want to advertise as deluxe. I actually am retired and live here in Jomtien so thought we would try this hotel for one night with possibility of more get away stays. I think the first thing wrong was the idea you have to pay for internet in room. Should be free as most other hotels and especially in Deluxe rooms. Two wicker chairs on balcony but no table to set drinks or snacks. The bed however was very comfortable but the room sparsely furnished. I was told there was coffee in the rooms but in fact one small packet of instant with hot water where I would have expected a small coffee pot in a deluxe room. The breakfast was large and lots of choices however the only thing that was hot were the eggs from the grill. Everything else were in serving trays with no tops and no heat. For instance the fried potatoes tasted like right out of the refrigerator. Definitely this hotel is great for a one night stay for the view but not any longer than that without some improvements. I would suggest upgrading some of the rooms to Deluxe with free Internet and you could charge a better price. William M wrote a review Nov 2015\n",

      "40 Great hotel, be prepared for the extras though First time staying here in the D Varee and also first time in Jomtein. I have to say this hotel gave me one of the best sea views I've had in a hotel and at this particular price point I don't think it can be beaten.    In terms of location its quite a way down the coast and warrants a taxi or long walk to some of the more lively areas but that's fine because the hotel is so large you don't really have to go out often.    Check-in was smooth and the only negative was being asked to write my credit card details down as well as 3 digit security code, unlike many other hotels they don't have the facility to swipe your card and hold a deposit so you can either leave ALL your card details in writing or pay a cask deposit.    I would say in general some areas of the hotel need modernisation but our room was fine and for the rate paid I was very happy. Clearly the D Varee are set-up to make money on extras and seem to charge for many things which are free in other hotels. For example, WiFi is 300 baht per day for room access???? The gym charges for water???? There is free WiFi in the lobby but it wasn't working on our first day of arrival.    I've given the D Varee 4 stars purely and simply because it offers a great room with the best sea view possible at a highly competitive rate. Throw in free WiFi and tidy up a bit and we would have a 5 star review here!! I would certainly stay here again despite the minor negatives and would recommend it especially if you like Jomtein.

      "40 .......... D Varee Jomtien Beach Pattaya D' Varee Pattaya is a marvellous property. A lovely hotel albeit in need of immediate refurbishing.. A huge structure ( 38 or 37 storey) almost on the beach , which , of course , is a huge plus... We were on level 27 and privileged to have an \"Ocean View Room with balcony\" .. It is really quite wonderful ..... looking down at the ocean, the feel is inexplicable ......... divine !!  It is a busy hotel , bus full of tourists / guests checking in, another group checking out .. no end to activity .... we had a fast check-in, the front desk ever so efficient and courteous...... I must say that the service is really very good...... I had a late supper and the food was indeed quite palatable.  The rooms are nice , neat and tidy, the batroom clean and free toiletries if you forgot that bar of soap or toothbruch or what !!  Breakfast is a huge affair , numerous guests , but a good, healthy and sumptuous fare is on offer ..........  We liked it and enjoyed our stay and thank the courteous, efficient and helpful staff..  Strongly recommended .......... mmbakar wrote a review Oct 2015\n",

      "40 Good Location, Excellent view This is situated in jomtien beach.  Ideal location if you are going with family or larger families.  Though the hotel needs to be improved, Specially furniture and wooden accessories.  The two reason for staying here is the balcony sea view and the two swimming pools.  It has also a rooftop bar in the 38th floor.  The 5th floor swimming pool is very nice with a view to the sea beach.  For some of the rooms you can see the coral island from the balcony.  the hotel itself is a very good. But interiors need to be improved. iamronex wrote a review Oct 2015\n"

The views from the hotel are breathtaking.I got a room on 25th floor.I could see the Koh Larn Island from my hotel.Unlike pattaya's walking street this place is completely quiet.There is not much thing close to it either(Mcdonalds,Burger king etc)But as were a family this was the best place for us.The rooms were outdated and somewhat clean.We couldnt lock our room because it was broken.We informed them and they fixed it(I thought i would get charged but i wasnt)It was pool on 5th floor and another one at first floor.The building has 38th floor.A bar was at 38th floor.We got welcome drinks there.(Apple Juice)  Overall this hotel is really beautiful.The views make your money worth.I would come back here again.

      "30 Chaos at it's best !! We were here for 3 days in Aug.. It's a mixed feeling.. Not sure who to blame.. The local travel agent ( ebookers.com ) took a booking for 3 ( 2 adult and a child ) of us but when reached the hotel, it was a different story.. The hotel reception was insisting on additional 1000 bhat a day for an extra bed for my little son.. This was the last thing I wanted after a 3 hour trip from Bangkok. I was really put off by the attitude of the staff at the front desk. I then asked them to put me onto the Hotel manager Geoff, I was made to sit there for 20 mins and a lady turned up, who said she was Geoff's boss.. She was not interested in hearing to anything I had to say.. Instead, she offered to speak to the travel agent by the evening and said will look into the matter.. ( Shame that the manager had no interest in listening to our plight )    Finally, I opted for a twin room on 18th floor. Honestly, had I known this before, I wouldn't have ever gone to this hotel.. The whole day I was thinking of moving to another hotel.    The Hotel : The hotel balcony has a breathtaking view of the sea and the entire Jomtien stretch. The rooms are very dated, however, the bed was firm and it had a working Aircon.. TV, Kettle and other furniture were very dated.. Rooms were cleaned daily but the linens not changed.    We were told that only two were allowed to have breakfast, so, we did not bother getting there as family and I was very reluctant to pay an additional 1K for breakfast. On one of the day, when I ventured out for breakfast, it felt like I was in China.. Absolute chaos !! Loads of Chinese people all over us, dirty tables, empty dishes.. It felt like all of the Chinese tourists were staying at this hotel.. breakfast was very average.. It is all about quantity and not quality..    All in all, it's very average for me.. This hotel has a very long way to go in putting their name in par with some of the other hotels we stayed in Bankgok.. gankamath wrote a review Sep 2015\n",

      "20 Rooms not like pictures If you are unlucky enough to get a room on the 2nd-5th floors (assuming those who book good rates online) you'll find the rooms in utter disrepute. The grounds are quite nice but like many other reviewers we found the room condition to be 1-2 star, lots of stains on the tiles, pint chopping off, mosquitoes abound and overall nothing like the pictures. We quickly checked out and found many 2-3 star places that were newer in much better condition and better overall deal. They need to spend $$ renovating rooms. Mark A wrote a review Aug 2015\n",

Luckily my daughter and boyfriend were given a free upgrade to their room and we were checked in promptly and efficiently by the friendly front desk staff. Rooms were clean and tidy with great ocean views. Unfortunately the lifts kept breaking down and we had numerous blackouts on our floor. The hotel is situated a little to far from most decent shops restaurants and bars, not their fault but my own choice next time I will stay closer to Pattaya and walking street. Hotel had 2 fantastic pools to make the most use of the sun. The restaurant on 38th floor has great views but expensive to drink.All staff friendly and helpful. Craig G wrote a review Aug 2015\n",
      "10 terrible hotel It was a terrible hotel in all dimensions:  1. Security: The room balconies are very close and people can move from one balcony to another. One morning we saw people from the next room smoking in our balcony.  2. Cleanliness: The rooms were really old, stuffy, smelly, and had molds in the bed furniture which was strangely fabric. It is just terrible for allergy sufferers.  3. Breakfast: It looked a lot but mostly local and very cold. Even the locals did not eat cold fish or chicken for breakfast. We had a five-year old child with us and he could not finish his bread. So, instead of wasting it we asked the guy whether we could take the left over bread-loaf with us. He rudely refused it and did not even listen to our offer to pay for it.  4. The beach: One of the selling points of this hotel is its closeness to the beach. However, the beach was extremely polluted with open sewage and other waste.  5. Location. It is far from the main attractions and you have fight with the local taxi drivers everyday to go places. We recommend north Pattaya. m051 wrote a review Aug 2015\n"

Views (day and night) from the balcony out to the beach and Pattaya was amazing.You will need to catch a bus in to the heart of the action - Walking Street etc which will set you back about 30bht each. The buffet breakfast catered for everybody and all tastes and cuisines.  Only con was that there was no free WIFi in the rooms only in the lobby. loves_2_learn_11 wrote a review Aug 2015\n",

The lifts were terrible, was waiting 10-20 minutes in the morning to get in the lift from 19th floor. Breakfast was nice however limited seated capacity so another 10 minute wait to be seated.

The rooms were good and clean .... the view to the swimming pool and ocean was breathtaking.  Breakefast was nice and you get very wide variety cuisine .    Our voucher said clearly maximum occupancy is 4 adults.  At time of check inn 2 only registered.  I was informed by front desk if u want to bring guests inn I need to register them and escort them for free.  Other wise just walk in and pay 1000 bhat.  later at night I bring my friend and I brought guests over to stay for night.  Both guests were registered and we were charged 1000bhat for each room.  We ended up paying 4000 bhat for 2 nights.  The other day I requested Duty manager on night shift to print some paper he said ill print 4 u each page for 25 baht.next morning I asked another duty manager on morning shift she acknowledged my request and printed few papers for me with no cost.  When I tried to argue the night shift duty manager about the 1000 bhat thing he threathened me and told me if I dont pay he will call security for me.    Our stay was nice and didnt give the hotel a bad rating coz I believe this was personal attitude of the Duty manager and not hotel policy.    I hope the management take this issue seriously.  For me I cannot compramize my Organazation reputation bcoz of single employee behaviour. Engineer A wrote a review Aug 2015\n",

However the new owners have installed an outdoor rock/ cabaret, that blasts out of large speakers until the early hours.

      "20 Great views but overcrowded hotel with poor customer service I have stayed at this hotel on average twice a year for the last 7 years. I have always come back because of the spectacular ocean views from most rooms (note: rooms on the sides of the hotel view more of the town and not very much of the ocean).    I am beginning to tire of the bus loads of tourists that stay here and overcrowd the hotel beyond the capacity of the few staff to cope. An example of this was the experience this time with breakfast. As part of a conference I stayed here for a week. However, each morning it was a challenge to get a seat at breakfast. The hotel has forgotten about customer service - the upper level of the breakfast area was empty (reserved for VIPs), while the lower level was overcrowded to the point of people regularly not getting a seat. Staff would not respond to this situation and refused for people to sit in the empty upper area. Occasionally there would be one person occupying the empty seating area for VIPs (around an additional 30-40 seats), while the mayhem at breakfast time meant people having to stand while they eat breakfast. The crowds were beyond the capacity of staff to clear tables for seating. This is a disgrace! Before the Manager TRIES to write an explanation (there is actually no adequate explanation for prohibiting people to occupy the only vacant seats while the breakfast area is grossly overcrowded) after my review I would remind him that I will no longer stay here because of this debacle described at breakfast.

The Cocktails are good and my preference is always for a Vodka Martini - very well executed in this establishment. The views in my opinion are the best in the area.

      "40 Elegant Ocean View Room This is my first stay at this hotel. Location is not in Pattaya downtown but it is not too far from there. Just only 15-20 minutes drive to South or Central Pattaya. Beach in front of hotel was excellent, just across the beach road. The room is great, 100% seaview with balcony and no any obstruction. Decoration is ok but some points need to be renovated. Amenities in the room were well prepared except there was no toothbrush and toothpaste. But that was ok, there is a 7-11 in front of the hotel. Breakfast quality and quantity is acceptable if compare with the price I paid. The elevators from lobby to the guest rooms are too slow and small. Pool on 5th floor is nice with ocean view. After checked out, I visited Cartoon Network Amazone Water Park. It took only 15 minutes drive which is very close. Next time I will stay at D Varee with my family and bring them to this water park also. Mew_Meekhun wrote a review Jul 2015\n"

      "30 oh no! Tags luxury, beach and pool on their TripAdvisor are probably bad jokes, to start with.  Am sitting here right now, actually, so it's pretty fresh experience.  Good things (not many!): view from almost any balcony is amazing any time of the day! One can spend the whole day there. Coffee in the lobby (paid one, of course) and breakfasts are ok.  Service at the reception is very good! But honestly speaking, talk to boys if available :) this is by no means discrimination, just their English is better, they are more polite, more quick and more hearty all in all.  Rooms and the whole hotel actually - very, VERY old. renovated in 60s?? Stains, things falling apart etc. Though yes! very clean.  Both pools are so stupid. They are big and both are for kids only! like 70 cm deep? By the end of the day temperature there is boiling hot! and no fun for adults, of course.  And yes, there is a beach, just 5 m from the hotel. But when you see it - you will never want to swim. It's swimming trashcan all around! Never seen a beach being this dirty!  Internet: free of charge in the lobby - very slow and connection is breaking off every 2 minutes. Today i tried paid Internet in my room - yes, it is perfect (though this is pretty expensive rate if you need that every day for several hours, for example).  And yes, complaints about loud Chinese tourist groups are all true, very true. Good thing though that they tend not to stay in the same hotel for several days - so there is a chance that each next night you might get other, less (or more?) loud neighbours.  All in all, even though the panorama and some really sweet people - will do my best not to come back, sadly. Gingeriana wrote a review Jul 2015\n",
      "30 Worth a visit Stayed for the second time in late May 2015. The service as usual was first class. The rooms are clean and serviced daily albeit at unpredictable times.    The breakfasts were a little better than when we last stayed with a few more options. It's better to be seated before 9.00am because the choices diminish towards the closing time of 10.00am.    There is a new bar Tequila Sunrise within walking distance to the south east which offers a full range of sports on 4 television receivers. Importantly, the beer is cold.

The newly renovated gym is well equiped for a person like me whose become a gym addict in recent times and don't feel guilty eating their amazing breakfast.

      "30 Quiet and Serene Chose this hotel due to the many good reviews in many other websites. It was an ok stay nothing much to shout about. Good thing the location is a little far from Pattaya City away from all the noise and traffic jam. Jomtien is laid back and many families come to spend the weekend by the beach. The hotel is located across a one way street to the beach and very convenient. The hotel has many facilities and among the best is the bar by the street and the roof top. Breakfast menu is better than it's counter part located in Silom Bangkok. The rooms are old and needs renovation. Cozy setting of a kitchenette and wardrobe. It's a gorgeous view of the sea from the balcony. Bathroom was not very clean and the towels need to be replaced with new sets coz some of the towels were stained. The bed sheet has also some spots. The coffee cup was not cleaned properly which had stains. It's a large hotel with 38 floors but the lift servicing these floors are insufficient. Many China nationals occupy this hotel which makes it pretty noisy and busy. At any time the lobby is full of guests either waiting to leave or checking in. Looking for other hotels located in the same area for the next visit. MathewMorais wrote a review Jun 2015\n",

      "50 Amazing hospitality and service! First of all the hotel's location is fantastic, 38 stories in the more quiet end of the Jomtien beach. There is a cocktail bar on the top floor with view of the whole Pattaya area which is lovely! The personnel are very polite and friendly, specially Miss Vera Biankina the guest service manager. She always took the time to make me feel at home. She upgraded me to the glass room (VIP room) for breakfast when I mentioned enjoying a more quiet atmosphere in the mornings! She is very fluent with her English so it was a refreshing experience. Mr Jeffry the general manager is also very kind and courteous. I enjoyed my stay immensely :-) Mamalee H wrote a review May 2015\n"

      "30 Great location This hotel is directly on the beach and close to all restaurants and bars . Also the beach in this area is quieter and more suitable for swimming.  It is a large hotel and I found the staff not as caring as I have found in other Thai hotels, however the quality of service was fine . A buffet breakfast was available each morning with a vast selection of fare . However some of the breakfast items are cooked outside so I little bit of searching and planning is required . I had finished my breakfast before noticing the outside cooking areas. Thomas C wrote a review May 2015\n",

But as the main customers of the D-Varee are Chinese, it's very hard to have quiet time. The hall reception and the breakfast restaurant are a big market!! At 5-6am you are wake up by the \"sweet\" voice of the Chinese countryside men screaming on people. I will never come back in this hotel, the management should educate their Chinese groups first.

I wouldn't consider this hotel any better than a 3 Star Hotel and I have stayed in better 3 Star Hotels here in Pattaya.

      "40 A solid 4/5 hotel Firstly the price was great. B7000 for 3 nights over a peak period, breakfast included, double room, sea view, balcony, aircon, shower and bath, 2 pools ( around 140 pounds).  Location- easy to get to. Close as you can get to the beach in Jomtien, a short walk across the road.  A roof top bar with a drink and tapas buffet, excellent.  Staff were helpful, courteous and professional.  The breakfast buffet was huge but disappointing. Dont get me wrong for the price i paid i was not that bothered but most of the food was cold. Ate it once, skipped it the other 2 days.  The only real problem at this hotel is not actually to do with the hotel itself. There are large groups of package tours. These people are, and trying not to generalize here, from a certain Asian country with a massive population (largest in the world i believe). They push in front of you when waiting for the elevator, shout and spit around the pool, act awfully in any shared space such as the lobby, bars, breakfast rooms etc. For this reason alone we did not spend much time using the hotel facilities, preferring to eat out and swim elsewhere. sabr0ad wrote a review Apr 2015\n",

But the place where the hotel is located is dead, like we left our room for a walk in evening and we found that the place is dead.. it was just 6pm and there was no gathering on the streets, bars were empty, beach was dirty as hell. But thanks to the Karaoke night at the hotel itself which was such a relief.

      "10 Please don't stay at this place D Varee Jomtien Beach was probably the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. When I made the decision to book, one of my friends strongly advised me against it because his recent stay there was horrible. But I wanted to have the ocean views and decided to book anyway. I've never regretted a hotel decision more. The receptionist demanded that I pay for the room upfront, instead of at checkout. So I paid them. The rooms are infested with fire ants. We had to ask THREE TIMES for toilet paper for the restroom. The wifi (which they advertise on their website) is NOT AVAILABLE in the rooms. You have to pay extra for the wifi, which I paid for and ended up getting g horrible service. I was traveling with friends, and we relied heavily on being able to use wifi for trip planning and communication. To make matters even worse, when it came time to check out of the hotel, I was informed by the receptionist that I was charged 100 Baht less than I should have been, and demanded that I pay the difference upon checkout. I asked the receptionist whose mistake it was that I was charged wrong, he told me it was their fault. So I asked him why I was bein made to pay extra because of their mistake. At this point, he called the manager to speak to me. A woman who spoke very little English came over to me and told me that she would be charging my card for the difference, and there's no reason for me to \"make an issue\" over nothing. I tried to explain to her that this was about the principle, not the actual 100 Baht. The difference in money only comes out to about $3, but the cost in my experience as a customer is absolutely priceless. Let me tell you, there are several other hotels along the same road, and you would be better off at ANY of them than spending a single night at that ant-infested, dirty, old, smelly hotel. To top it off, you will be disrespected by the management if you dare raise an issue with them. Spend your hard-earned money elsewhere. Wintameha wrote a review Feb 2015\n",

      "10 Nightmare on Jomtien Beach My girlfriend and I have been here for two nights. We thought it was a \"tropical resort\" from the ads and other reviews, but on check in we discovered that we were booked into a bus tour resort, with 1960's era rooms, that would make a budget motel seem gracious. We awaken every morning to the revving of jet skis (there is a boat ramp in the place of a beach across from the hotel's front entrance, for the notorious jet ski rental trade), in the afternoon as the hotel staff leave the underground parking ground, there are two plus hour of tweeting security guards, blowing police whistles directing traffic. When the whistles die down, there is a cacophony of a flock of filthy black birds, that reside in the trees adjacent to the boat ramp. But, you'll be so dizzy from the constant whistle blowing that you'll be unable to detect when one stops and the other starts up. It's a constant three hours of constant incessant, irritation as the golden red ball of the sun drops into the sky, ruining what we came to Thailand for. peace quiet and local food and relaxation. the food at the hotel ranges from the execrable to insipid (not stars to one). There is literally, nothing to do in the evening unless your taste runs to the seedy bars in nearby Pattaya (Yuck). The streets outside of the hotel are littered with garbage and motorbike gangs of youths. And if you want to just hang out in the hotel...the pool closes early, so that's out and then at 11PM a horrible garage band playing 30 year old music, out of tune, screaming at the top of their lungs, cranks up until after midnight so loudly that you can't hear your room TV, you have to keep the doors close and the curtains drawn, to dampen the noise, which is so loud that the windows literally shake in the rooms.    In sum, this is more of a two plus star quality hotel suited for bus tours or package tourists, not for discerning travelers seeking a resort quality experience.    Please let us out. Even some Singapore hotel on a fake beach (albeit clean) would be preferable to this place.    Robert and Buffeye from America.    PS, we love the Trip Advisor choices in writing this review. \"Would you consider this hotel trendy?\" Well compared to a brothel in Mexico full of drug runners, or somewhere in a Philippines slum, its different, but that's about as good as it gets.

      "30 Below-average hotel, but above-average view I had high expectations judging from the pictures on the site I used for booking the room. But contrary to the fresh-looking image portrayed by D-Varee, we were presented with a worn-down, dirty and smelly unit, and we had black feet after walking barefooted on the floor. I should have known better; the hotel is an old building which has been renovated, but interiors still look scruffy. Bonus points for friendly staff and a very service-minded Russian lady who checked us in. And obviously the seaview, which is really why you book this place. Views can't be faulted but I'm not so sure we'll return. JE Jakobsen wrote a review Jan 2015\n",
      "40 superb hotel.excellent price. far from central pattaya This is a 3 -4 star hotel right in the Beach front. The location is great and less crowded and you can have a private beach time. unfortunately if you want to be in the happening area like walking street or central Pattaya its really far away and one has to get a scooter taxi or car to travel and it takes about 45 minutes to get to central pattaya and around 200-250 THB. Tuktuks can take you for about 20-30 THB but you will not find a tuktuk to return back to the hotel that easily (almost never). The surrounding area has a 7-11 and few good street food shops..There are plenty of beach water activities in this arearea too The hotel has 38 floors and looks imposing and beautiful I have to stay. Gym, spa, swimming pool with poolside jacuzzi are all superb.There is also a seafood buffet with good live music with sea views. I found that the rooms are rather old fashioned and retro though but i guess reasonable for the price. The staff were very accomodative and checked me in early at no extra cost. I was given a complementary sea facing room which i really appreciated. Overall superb hotel for the money value. But the distance from central pattaya and the hassle of transport would make me think about staying there again, unless the hotel considers some sort of cheap shuttle to the central area. tkrisnadas wrote a review Jan 2015\n",

We really enjoyed the amazing views and nice evening since the balcony was big enough to accommodate 8 people. hduisters wrote a review Jan 2015\n"

      "10 D Varee Exectutive Club What do you expect when you book an Executive club room with a hotel group which prides itself on its Thai hospitality and deep passion for excellence? Is it firstly a club room which you could call your own, where the staff recognise you and try to provide a premium level of service to make your stay a pleasure, or is it little treats like a well-stocked mini bar in a premium room or even free internet access (a standard in most hotels now) or a lovely fruit basket in your room on arrival?  Well what the D Varee group gives you none of these, instead you get tired accommodation years past its sell by date, a mini bar stocked with only water (nothing else is allowed), a £20 demand for internet accesses and a club room permanently locked and unstaffed.  Possibly worse is what you do get, you are invited for free drinks at the cocktail bar on the 38th floor however as an executive club member you are only allowed tea, coffee of Chang beer, in solace you could take advantage of your 20% discount at the a-la-carte restaurant but it is also permanently closed. What you have though is the constant indignity of every time you wish to take advantage of a service you are entitled to of having to explain over and over again that you are a member of their Executive club, at which point you are treated with distain more like a third class passenger than a first.  All together a dismal experience made worse by staff who could not care less about you or the service which they are providing.  Shocking Chris R wrote a review Jan 2015\n",

This hotel has two swimming pools one is on fifth floor second one is on ground floor, pool is also was very good.  We've got this hotel with 70% discount, so the value of money for us was also good.  Bit strange thing with this hotel is that the internet is for 300 batt for one day use.

      "20 Hotel's best days behind it I have stayed at this hotel many times over the past 7 years, When it first opened it was called the Nusa Playa and it was a great classy hotel with excellent rooms, breakfast, service and sea views. All that really remains is the sea views. The rooms are out of date, beds are uncomfortable and the cleanliness of the rooms is not great, its a hit and miss most likely a miss! We were moved to 3 different rooms in 3nights, it was a nightmare. Ants, bedbugs galore in some rooms! Finally we just settled in a room and avoided noticing all the problems, The vodka definitely helps numb the expectations. This hotel needs an overhaul, someone needs to invest in bleach and bleach everything starting from the bathrooms. The pools need to be cleaned and I doubt since opening anyone has bothered to clean the pool tiles. I would avoid this hotel unless you are obsessed with sea view, as everything else is simply poor. The breakfast is nothing to rave about and the best thing at breakfast to eat is toast. The eggs are cold and rubbery, the hot food is obviously from the night before and bacon is non existent. This hotel could have been great but 7 years after it was built it definitely deserves a spot on the list of worse hotels in Jomtien. Aryatravel03 wrote a review Dec 2014\n",

We stayed in a 2 bedroom Ocean view room. The room was huge with a large hall and 2 bedrooms. The bedrooms are also huge and and every room offered balconies with sitting areas that afford great views of the ocean all over. The restaurant is huge and provides a good buffet breakfast. I do agree with other reviewers that the rooms require some facelift. The reception quality also needs improvement and should be more prompt and guest friendly. The rooms feature DVD Player, Home theatre type entertainment systems, Big LCDs in all the rooms and big beds. The sofa in the living room was huge and the setting is perfect for a family who intend to relax in the comforts and cosiness of the hotel. However, what was missing was a kitchen in the room. Overall, a good hotel with a very good location and offering great ocean views from the rooms itself. Also, near to the shopping areas for shopping buffs. maulik1171 wrote a review Nov 2014\n",
      "30 D Varee needs a reno Booked a family suite and stayed on the 30th floor, it had two bedrooms and two bathrooms and a lovely sea view. The room was very tired and outdated with a need of a renovation. In fact the complete hotel is very tired and weathered and would benefit from a complete renovation. When I booked on the internet I requested an early check in of 1230Hrs. I didn't have a response from the hotel. I sent them a second email to request the early check in, still no response. (I would of been happy to pay an additional cost for that) I turned up at 1230Hrs and the front desk said check in time is 1400Hrs. The front desk then went on to say reservations are the department that looks after those requests. I might add that i had I provided them with my email and Thailand local mobile number. After showing them the two requests for the early check in and some further discussion they reluctantly gave me the early check in. This must of upset them, because they gave me the keys and that was it. No information on where breakfast was served, location of pool, gym or anything. Later in the day I went down to the front desk and asked for that very information but it was like pulling teeth.    The rooftop bar on the 38th Floor is excellent, great view and lovely relaxing ambience. We sat on the south side of the rooftop bar. There was corner lounge that looked very comfortable but that was reserved or as some of you many know in Thailand a VIP table card was placed there. I questioned the waitress, maybe we were expecting a visit from the Thailand Royal Family H.M. Unfortunately that was not the case, in fact they were expecting a visit from the owners cousin. We stayed there in anticipation of the VIPs presence for approx 2Hrs unfortunately they never turned up and the VIP table card was removed, enabling the general public to the VIP area.    To sum up for $220 Aud a night for the family suite it is overpriced and I would not stay or recommend this hotel to anyone. Mark A wrote a review Sep 2014\n",
      "30 No furniture. Stayed at D Varee for 10 nights in late August. Having paid in advance, the booking in procedure even at 10.30 pm was relatively painless. Getting to the Unit on Floor 12 was a bit more complicated. Fact is there are only three lifts (elevators) to service 38 floors and we had to wait and wait before one would arrive and then wait again while the queue in front of us cleared.    It was an ongoing experience.    The Units themselves are quite spacious with a relatively large refrigerator, which is somewhat rare in hotels of this type in Asia. Congratulation are in order. The sea view from the 12th Floor was good so there's no need to go to the 38th Floor which basically offered the same view.    The staff were helpful and quite courteous. Full marks.    On the down side, there was no Patio furniture. No table, not a single chair. A relatively large Patio with good views but no opportunity to sit and have a drink. Checked with the front desk and yes it was deliberate. No Patio furniture. Further, the charges for Internet Access are a joke. Nat255068 wrote a review Sep 2014\n"

      "20 Disappointed I had stayed at this hotel on two previous occasions and as I like quiet , a sea view and value for money I rebooked. What a sad third visit. They gave me a room on the 2nd floor , dirty walls, mould in the bathroom , a musty smell and worse of all no sea view. Upon checking with reception which as other reviewers have noticed lacks a welcoming attitude I was told that is what you booked and an upgrade to a renovated (a joke) higher floor will cost an extra 1000 per night. After telling them I had stayed twice before and been given a higher floor for the same price the 1000 was reduced to 500. I paid the extra and was moved to a similar room slightly cleaner but still very dated (clunky old tv's, walls need painting) on the 25th floor. This is a large hotel (480 rooms) , not busy this time of year and there is no need to dump guests into dirty mouldy rooms on the lower floors. To summarise this is a 3 star (not 3.5 star) hotel in a quiet part of Jomtien which if given a seaview just about represents value for money ( note there is an internet surcharge) at a $50 price point . tim r wrote a review Aug 2014\n",
      "10 Drjsaleh A big disappointment.  My cousin booked this hotel online before reading any reviews about it.  For a hundred dollars a night we expected a decent hotel.  Our first encounter was with the reception staff who lacked professional attitude, were non-smiling, non- welcoming and were not helpful.  The room itself was in need of maintenance. Housekeeping was non- responsive.  Thai restaurants are generally known for their good Breakfast, but not this hotel!  Black tea was terrible, cheese was not to be found on the buffet nor on the menu, and the tables were not properly cleaned.  This is a hotel that I would not recommend to my friends.  In summary it has an issue of poor management. drjsaleh wrote a review Aug 2014\n",

      "10 This is the hotel NOT to book Booking was made several months in advance, directly with hotel via online. The photos on the website are not actual photos of the room you make your booking. Standard/Deluxe and Executive bookings are all the same room. Different floor changes with price. I made booking with Executive and was not impressed with the room on arrival as it had no decor, furniture was old and beaten, the entire room should have been renovated several years prior.  Certain \"benefits\" were explained upon checkin but no one in the hotel understood what an customer receives with a Executive room booking. Discounts for food and laundry were not calculated as promised in the final check out billing.  Staff were not trained and the entire atmosphere of the hotel was not customer orientated. Bus loads and bus loads of tour groups arrived and this was the target \"one time\" customer for the hotels' business.  If you are a couple looking for a hotel with new decor and customer service; this is not the place to make a booking !!!  Good location with excellent views from balcony yes this hotel has, but the hotel is old, the staff not trained and the hundreds and hundreds of bus tours moving through the hotel daily is not ideal for couples.  The morning breakfast buffet resembles something of a high school cafeteria, food quality was poor, and same selection daily.  Meals were priced considerably high for this standard hotel and with the added 10% hotel and 7% VAT taxes made the prices ridiculous !  Lots of great hotels in Jomtien and Pattaya to choose from and stay away from this \"bus stop/cafeteria !!! SilicaStorm wrote a review Aug 2014\n",
      "50 Awesome Hotel We spent about 3-4 days here late last year. We weren't really expecting much until we went inside the premises of the hotel. It was beautiful! All the plants around you and the stone steps aesthetically placed leading to the rooms area. We were even able to meet a couple of new people while we were there the food's fantastic and I really miss their coffee. Their staff is also very accommodating! Rooms are very clean and we were able to sleep peacefully at night. :) I'd recommend this place to anyone! It's a really nice place especially for it's price! Will definitely be back. :) Neungiee wrote a review Aug 2014\n",

      "20 Nice view from the window. Old building, furnitures. The hotel have been renamed from something...i guess Furama... to D Varee. The building is old. The room and furnitures are also old and need renovation. Staffs are ok but not great. The breakfast was terrible and there were not enough seats for everybody. Swimming is nothing special. The good thing about this hotel is that rooms on high floors offer spectacular view of the beach and sea. Will not stay here again. Tommy N wrote a review Jul 2014\n",

      "30 Go on give us a smile! Please? We got a very good deal online with nearly 50 percent off. This was what swayed us towards booking with D Varee. If you wanna be away from the hustle and bustle of Pattaya like we did then this place is great for you location wise. However overall we were slightly disappointed and just glad we didn’t pay the normal room rate as I would have expected more for the money.    As we walked in I was impressed by the lobby as it is very grand and looks like a 5 star hotel. What dampened my spirits and brought me back to reality however were the 5 staff on reception who made no efforts to make eye contact or say Hello as we were waiting to be seen. It was an effort to get a smile out of the staff. When we did finally speak with them there was still no hint of a smile or greeting from any of them.    After they had taken payment for the room they told us we were in a twin room. We booked a double room and stressed that this was what we had paid for. We were told ‘We don’t have one available’ No apology, not even a smile! This went on for a couple of minutes. I asked if there was anything else available and she said ‘you must pay more for a King Room’. I asked if she thought this was fair and she never replied. They said we could change to another room the following day. As we were only staying for 2 nights this was disappointing. When we got to the room there were no chairs on the balcony, 2 coffees, 1 tea and only one creamer. Now call me petty but when you pay a certain amount of money you expect some if not all of these things to be in order. It does make you feel tedious having to ask for these things more than once. So I ring reception and ask them if they can assist. After everything is in place I decide to run a bath. However I only stay in it for 2 minutes as there is no hot water. The rooms themselves are a little dated and there was a strong smell of drains that became more obvious when you left the room and re-entered.    The following Saturday morning we went to the breakfast buffet which was a success. There was a good choice of food for everyone and we really enjoyed it.vHowever on the Sunday this was a different story. As we entered the room we realised there was no where to sit and there were lots of people walking around also looking for somewhere to sit. I went up to the lady on the door and said ‘There is no where to sit. You should stop letting people in as there is no room!’ She didn’t seem to understand what I was saying and continued to let people keep walking in. Some would call this a language barrier – I however would call this common sense as it was obvious to everyone what was going on. We did eventually manage to find a table which we shared with someone. OK we have a seat now lets go get some food…..or not. There was no bacon and no eggs! Every time the food was brought out this was cleared in seconds as there were too many people waiting. I did manage to get an egg after waiting for 20 minutes. This was disappointing. As a Westerner who lives in Bangkok I had been waiting for an International breakfast for so long but this dream was short lived and I never did get my bacon!    Both pool areas were nice to relax in and the gardens around the building were pretty and quaint. The view from the room was also great    A lick of paint, a change of furniture and a few smiles would go a long way at D Varee. Claire S wrote a review Jul 2014\n"

      "40 Nice hotel but charges for wifi Nice hotel but charges for wifi - how very 20th century. We stayed in the off season so had a very highly reduced price room - this ticked the box for us, as there's no way I'd have paid the rack rate for the hotel. Yes it's a nice hotel with 2 pools & a quality feel, but there's a lot better value places to stay than D Varee at rack rate. If you can get a discounted rate it's worth a stay, but if not look elsewhere. Martutd wrote a review Jul 2014\n",
      "40 Beautiful Beach facing hotel, live upto the standards, good choice for couples We were booked at this hotel by our tour operator-Kesari from 22-25 June 2014. The Early impression was good, formalities were quick. We booked the room on 16th floor facing the beach. The view from the room is breathtaking. The long stretch of Jomtien beach and the refreshing envoirment lives up to the expectation. The rooms are clean and regularly updated by the staff. The bathroom and toilets too are clean and good. The hotel ranks well on amenities. we were booked for daily breakfast in the morning which was good and wide range. The hotel staff especially the house keeping staff are very helping and available. The services are fast and good. Would recommend the hotel for couples. Keep up the good work. The added attraction of the hotel is the DII3 bar at the 38 th floor- breathtaking view, awesome music and inviting and cordial staff. Kudos to Jomtien!! Kushal K wrote a review Jun 2014\n",

Room prices are fair and any beach view room is the best choice. Good breakfast and staff is helpful.  Internet and drinks are not cheap but the happy hour at DIB (D Varee Inspiration Bar) at penthouse is worth. There are good and cheap restaurants, massage spa and 7eleven around neighborhood.

      "30 Good location and view from the room The hotel is located on the jomtien beach and rooms have sea view and that is the only reason I stay at this hotel. But the rooms really need major renovations. At the price they are charging, there are many other options. I'm a regular and have been staying since it glory days of Furama and thought after D'Varee took over, it might become better, but they haven't made any changes.    The breakfast is ok (it used to be amazing before). The people on live counter to make omelette are always in a crappy mood and need an attitude adjustment. Only after I spoke rudely in Thai did they become polite but it shouldn't be that way.    Will try the place once more soon hopefully and if everything is still the same, I won't come back.

      "30 Hotel OK; Jomtien pretty horrible As advertised. We had a family suite, although I would recommend getting 2 or 3 rooms instead. The FS is about 3x the price of a standard room, but they only give you 4x breakfasts, so if you have more people it seems not worth it. The main issue with the FS is that they are located at the very end of the hallways on either end, at the edges of the hotel. The views aren't very good as the other rooms and the wifi doesn't work (even if you pay the extortionate rates for it). So, in all, having the most expensive and largest room on the property gets you the worst of everything. Nice one.    As some reviewers have also said, the check in is a disaster. Our experience was the same as others reported here. Half hour of confusion with inept staff and seemingly nobody in charge. The wifi is indeed an enormous ripoff. Every $2 cafe along the road has it for free, so why is it B100 per hour at my hotel???    Strangely enough, we also experienced a general lack of friendliness in the staff, but also overall in Jomtien. This is sort of the one place I have ever been in Thailand where people aren't smiling or very friendly. Oddly enough.    The clientele here is about 80% Thai and 20% Russian. I could see zero other nationalities except for ourselves, which was curious. The breakfast is steadfastly mass-market low end buffet. There were however enough reasonably cooked Thai dishes to make it interesting over the 4 days.    This is a giant package tour hotel, and a hotel room is about US$50. You get what you pay for (apart from the wifi!). Expect exactly that and you won't be disappointed. Jomtien itself was disappointing though. It is as dirty as Pattaya, but without the circus that at least makes Pattaya interesting. It is also far less properly developed which means that although there are a lot of people, shacks, and trash there is very little proper shopping or food. You sort of end up with the worst of Pattaya but not what good it has to offer either.    If I had to go back, I would stay up in Pattaya itself. Unless you have some very specific reason why you need to be down in Jomtien, it is certainly not worth staying in that area. HKguy wrote a review Apr 2014\n"

      "30 Hotel a mixed bag All in all, the hotel is a mixed bag. There are positives about this hotel but also negatives.    Let's start with the positives. Room was on the 24th floor with great foreground view of Jomtien beach and central Pattaya and Ko Lan in the distance. Fairly good value for money with decent size room and all amenities included (hairdryer, toiletries, fridge, very comfortable twin bed).    Another positive was the really good rooftop bar on the 38th floor. Staff were friendly enough and amazing great panoramic views. It's a nice place to have a drink, listen to music and relax. There is a decent café on the ground floor too at the front of the hotel.    First negatives was that the reception desk staff seemed confused, with a noticeable lack of organisation and lack of customer services skills (greeting guest, general friendliness and smiling would be an improvement). When we checked in at our scheduled time of 2:00pm, we noticed around fifty people sitting in the lobby waiting to be told when they could go to their room. After a little hesitation and uncertainty, we were told (without any apology) to sit and wait in the lobby (even though we had an reservation for a standard room). After sitting for 10 minutes, my partner approached the reception for an explanation (and to ask them to basically get their act together). We were told that the room we had booked was not available so they would now upgrade us to a superior room at no extra cost. Even though this was a nice bonus, all we wanted was to check-in and get taken immediately to our room, like any other hotel with decent organisation and customer service.    Another negative is the rip-off charging of Wi-Fi to use in the hotel room. For two hours it's a hefty 250 baht. It's actually cheaper going to the nearby café where Wi-Fi is free and you can have a coffee for around a hundred baht.    Finally, the staff could be friendlier and learn a few customer service skills. Very few of them spoke English. The cleaning staff were friendly though and so too were the staff in the rooftop bar. It's just a shame about many of the other staff. There were a lot of Thais and Russians staying there but not so many other nationalities, so the hotel is not really catering for Westerners so much.    Finally, the location is a little far away out from centre of Pattaya, although you can take a taxi for around 200 baht.    It's difficult to say not to try this hotel. But if the negatives are particular issues for you then better to avoid. TheTraveller081 wrote a review Apr 2014\n",

We stayed in many many new hotels before but we just happened to try the renovated Furama. Because it was an old hotel with probably old facilities we didn't expected it to be like the five-star types so everything turned out to be above expectation and we enjoyed our stay.  There was no problem with the water, the recption, the pools or restaurants. There was ample at breakfast. Just 2 comments: the service at the restaurant was unprofessional for the price of food paid (The phad thai noodles was half raw and the waitresses at the beachfront restaurant were lazy ) and there were hardly any slopes for strollers.

The free flow we were told was 1 free beer on the roof terrece. Needed to talk to the manager to explain what we had booked and what was on offer.

      "10 At least the walls are thick enough so you don't hear the neighbors I chose an 'Exec Room' at an extra charge for this hotel because on the website they said \"Late check-out for Exec Rooms, 4pm, when available\". I get to hotel and receptionist says \"Late Checkout is 1000 baht\". So I guessed there were rooms available if they are trying to sell late checkouts for an extra 1000 baht. But when I pointed out that my room rate included free late checkout if available, she told me \"rooms not available\". Either SHE, or her MANAGER, or the WEBSITE was misleading me. What they should say is 'Late checkout is available if you pay EXTRA EXTRA. But ONE extra is not enough! GUSFORDGIN wrote a review Feb 2014\n",

      "40 pleasant staying experienc stayed for 2 nights only.Excellent hotel.clean,well kept & specious rooms. Great view form room balcony. I personally loved wide spread at the breakfast time & the specious restaurant where almost half of the guest of hotel can take B.F together & would find something for everyone.. wonderfully designed.Best for honeymoon-couple as its situated a li'l far from central pattaya where all the lively things happen.for that reason only we shifted to another hotel into there. But a pleasant staying experience was it with my partner. sayo85 wrote a review Jan 2014\n",
      "40 Very impressive smooth hotel at perfect location I avoided staying at D Varee hotel ( previously named Furama) because the reviews on some websites were mixed.  Yesterday I stayed here for one night because the location suited me perfectly for my work around there. I booked Executive suite that was located on the 14th floor and had a large bed room and separate living room with big balcony over viewing the sea. View was very beautiful right from the level of bed and sofa even.  The hotel is pretty big, located conveniently and perfectly in the middle of jomtien beach and about 1 km from the busy soi 1-5 but on the main road and facing the beach.  It has 2 swimming pools, several decent restaurants/bars and one bakery shop. One of the restaurant/bar \" B Beach\" is on the ground floor facing the beach and has live music and BBQ food buffet at dinner time. I had my drinks and some snacks in this restaurant and service, food and the drinks were perfectly fine.  Breakfast was pretty good with choice of fresh fruits, bottled juices, breads, eggs and several thai and other dishes. Chef Piyacha took good care of me. Thanks to him.  I would say that it must be one of the best hotels in jomtien beach and I was pretty happy and satisfied with my stay.  Its a smooth hitel and at very decent prices compared with other hotels in jomtien or south/north pattaya and I am happy to recommend this hotel to fellow travelers.

Avery uncooperative staff.check in time is 2pm we reached at 2:10 pm but were made to wait for 2 hours in the lobby as they said the room was not ready and even after that no one was bothered v had to remind them to give us a room ...very disappointing!! The condition of the room is also not up to th mark not worth it, total waste of money. We had already paid for the extra person in the room but they asked us to pay more again for th extra bed/breakfast. ....breakfast was of the same standard, will never recommend this place for vegetarians and others too, be careful not worth staying.

      "10 Rip-off..A dump with a view in filthy Jom Tien ....yukkk My secretary reserved this dump for 4 days. I returned to BANGKOK after one night. The only nice thing was the view and the high floor. Very tempting to just jump and forget about this terrible place. First of all the rip off 300 baht taxi ride from central pattaya, then the filthy roads, millions of cheap russian tourist (really cheap and noisy,sorry) then internet for 500 baht extra (hilton value) and then the daaaaated rooms with oooold tv sets. No lcd... Ah yesss and on soi 14, sooooo really far from eerything. Walking street like 2 hours walking, banglamung 3 hs and greedy people everywhere. I thought pattaya was already the worst (see my other reviews) but this city and hotel is the worst place i stayed this year. So happy i am already back in bangkok with nice,real thai hospitable people, not those pattaya gangsters.... If you want to do you a favor...please do not go to pattaya.and by no means go to jo m tien because only a thai prison can be worse....

      "40 Nice hotel with beautiful sea view We visited this hotel during the Kesari FT tour to Pataya-Bangkok-Thailand from 10-Nov-13 to 16-Nov-13. We stayed here for 3 nights. Hotel has a spacious room with balcony to enjoy the sea. Beds were very comfortable for kids to sleep. Rooms were neat & tidy.  Breakfast was good with lots of variety. They have ample amount of space to have relax breakfast for their guest. Swimming pool is also there but unfortunately we didn’t get chance to enjoy it. Overall, it is a good hotel near sea. shami2282 wrote a review Nov 2013\n",
      "20 not worth it overturned old Furama Jomtien (the name that local people are familiar with in case red car taxi drivers are confused by its new name) lobby condition is average, however room condition is below average. Hotel amenities are primitive, feel overused. No free wifi is provided. Breakfast has some varieties of Thai food and somewhat other Eastern and Western.    Jomtien beach is quiet, along the beach street at the back of the hotel is a dead trail comparing to Pattaya main beach near the notorious Walking Street.    Choose other place if you are looking for a lively surrounding. Blueberrydee wrote a review Nov 2013\n",
      "40 Excellent views Furama Jomtien (that's how this was called when we visited), has excellent rooms with a view.  The rooms are spacious enough even though the balcony was quite small.  The pool is good and the happy hour deals are great. If you talk nicely and tip the barman, you can get happy hour deals anytime of the day ;-)    The breakfast buffet is good with a huge range of options. A few more healthy options wouldn't hurt though. We did not try the menu options as there were a plenty of street vendors selling a wide range of exotic dishes around.    The massages were very expensive and you don't get much. We found some nice massage parlours just outside of the hotel that provided an excellent service for a much cheaper price.    I would highly recommend this hotel and wouldn't hesitate staying there again. YohanDeSilva wrote a review Nov 2013\n",
      "40 Suprising, Delightful, AND a Good Value at 3-Stars OK, happy travelers, here's a quiz for you: how do you build a hotel and give EVERY room an ocean view?    The answer is, only build half a hotel!    And that's exactly what the D-Varee chain has done at Jomtien, and it works great. The hotel is a massive, modern, 38-story concrete edifice that glistens in the Thai sunlight. I'd give it a solid 3-star rating; it's not the Ritz Carlton but for a family hotel it does great.    Built in the shape of a crescent, curving away from the ocean, every room actually does have an ocean view. From the ocean-side, it looks like a giant white ear of corn, because every room as it's own private curving balcony. It's when you step off the elevator that you are surprised -- because instead of a long hallway to your room, it's another balcony. Hanging off the back of the hotel, 30+ stories in the air. It was such a surprise it took my breath away.    Lets get down to some of the details:    First, Jomtien Beach is NOT Pattaya Beach. Pattaya Beach is crowded, tacky, dirty and squalid. Jomtien Beach is a place Disney would go... relatively clean, uncrowded, and much more family-oriented. If you're looking for sordid night life, this is NOT the hotel for you.    This also means you're in for a drive. The Pattaya Bus Station is 2 hours southeast of Bangkok (Emakai station). Jomtien Beach is about 30 minutes south of the Pattaya station, by taxi. If you're driving to a hotel in Pattaya, you can ride on a jitney with 10 of your friends, but it will take a while to get to your hotel. I paid 300 baht for the ride, private car to Jomtien, each way, so I guess that's the going rate.    The hotel is set back from the street, and there's a handsome pavilion to walk you back from the ocean to the hotel. In the front of the hotel (street side) on this pavilion is a handsome bar with live music at night. There's also an eye-popping swimming pool. And it's also where breakfast is served. You'll like it!    There also is ANOTHER swimming pool, on the 5th floor. It's even nicer than the first-floor pool, and less crowded. I spent some significant time with the bartender there and we did well. Happy hour is from 1-3 pm, buy-one, get-one-free beer. Does it get any better than that?    The neighborhood is fine. Relatively clean, well-served with jitney busses (20 baht for a ride up the beach), and numerous restaurants and pubs. Take care on the sidewalks -- like most of Thailand, smooth sideways are rare. Signs and menus are in English, Thai and Russian. In fact, you're going to think your in Little Moscow, because all the voices you hear will be Russian, and maybe a smattering of Chinese. As an English-speaker, I was clearly the odd man out.    Checking in was a snap; service was fast and efficient. The room is fine but nothing great; moderately large, with a great balcony, an OK bathroom, and a luggage rack. The flat-screen TV has 70 channels, so you'll definitely have something to watch. The big thrill is hanging out on the balcony. Bring some wine or a beer... it's that much fun.    Now there are a few problems. The hot water is provided by \"instant-on\" water heaters, and it never gets really hot. There maybe a way to crawl under the sink and adjust this, but I never bothered. It was OK.    The hotel does not have free WIFI. What's up with that? It's the 21st century for heavens sake! Actually, their wifi is expensive... so look for coffee shops instead.    There are not enough elevators, and sometimes they cancel themselves and don't pick you up. We also had one that went down and started back up without ever taking us to the lobby. So we rode around a bit... more amusing than annoying.    The breakfast buffet is huge, but not terribly varied. It's just a great way to feed about a zillion people every morning. It's in two rooms and outside... I always sat outside and fed the birds. You won't go hungry but the coffee sucks.    Overall, this hotel was an unexpected delight. I paid US$70 a night, breakfast included, and would go back anytime. It was that nice. PilotMike2009 wrote a review Oct 2013\n"

After twenty minutes or so of chatting with customer service (because they were insisting that the online booking made a mistake) Anyways, they finally switched us into a better room.  The first room had old worn furniture, peeling wallpaper and had a lot if human hair everywhere. The second room was a low floor suite but much better than the first.    Annoyances:  40 minutes for room service to deliver ice. Both pools close really early (7:30) and rooms smell slightly sewerish.    Bonus's:  Location, views, two pools and lobby has nice interior design. Also close to a great Italian restaurant. Olsonleavy wrote a review Sep 2013\n",

      "30 Very good for Jomtien Beach If you want to stay in Jomtien, you can't do too much better. That said, I was disappointed. For a hotel trying desperately to pass itself off as a four star, they are much more like a three star instead. The hotel is nice and certainly has all the amenities of a four star hotel. From a nice restaurant, two wonderful pools, nice gym, a great spa, and a view that can't be beat. However the rooms left a lot to desire. They were surprisingly sparse of furniture and what was there is old and worn out. Except for the two very small draws in the night stands and the one on the desk, there wasn't anyone in the entire room. I guess they expect you to live out of your suitcase. The closet had few hangers, the bed was hard, the bathroom worn and not well kept, and when the wind picks up it comes right through the sliding glass doors. I was surprised by the lack of quality of the building up close. There were gaps in the flooring, mold on the shower curtain, there was no way to keep water from getting on the floor while taking a shower, the towels were thin and worn out, and the furniture was circa 1980s. All that said, the hotel has been rebranded. I would assume they are getting ready to do a renovation. If so, this could easily be turned into a quality four star hotel. They have everything else there to make one happy. Edward V wrote a review Sep 2013\n",
      "50 Surprisingly Good Jomtien Beach is quieter that Pattaya however a quick cab ride gets you into the livelier parts of Pattaya. Nice uncrowded beach literally accross the road and the hotel provide a security guard to see you accross the road even though its not that busy - nice touch. Food in the restaurant is good and the coffee shop with 1 hour free wifi is great.  This is a first class hotel we were originally on the 13th floor which we felt was too risky for our adventurous 2 year old. The hotel changed us to a garden room on the second floor which was perfect. Ok we lost the view but we had peace of mind and it was very pleasant to sit out and the patio was spacious. Good selection at breakfast. The pools were not at all crowded even though the hotel was fully booked!  This was definatly the case as we tried to book for more nights and couldn't, that proves this hotel is good value for money.  Would use again and recommend alsy30 wrote a review Aug 2013\n",

The view was spectacular and the sea breeze refreshing. flat screen tv in bedroom and conventional tv in living room which has a large comfortable sofa, writing desk and kitchen table with 4 chairs. coffee making facilities and fridge but nothing else.  shower over the bath(which I hate) and water impossible to regulate temperature.  Either fully hot or fully cold. (I hate cold showers)  Towels ok but some torn.(should be thrown out)  All the staff we met very helpful and efficient.  Three elevators, but only 2 go past floor 5.

      "50 Must Be One Of The Best If Not \"The Best\" In Jomtien My family & I travel to Thailand almost every year visiting Bangkok and the country's various islands. But since we have only 2 weeks left of our 7 weeks vacation (having spent a week in the UAE followed by 4 weeks in Australia), I opted to divide our remaining time between Pattaya which is the nearest beach destination and in Bangkok. We headed towards the Chonburi province in the town of Jomtien where the hotel is located. It is my first time to stay in D Varee Hotel (formerly called Furama). Usually when in Pattaya, my favorite is Siam Bayshore but the area has become more and more noisy as it is smack in the middle of the night life and neighboring red light district, the Walking Street. Jomtien on the other hand (about 6km. from vibrant Pattaya City) is still relatively quiet and family oriented with a long stretch of fine sandy beaches that is just right across from us. This hotel is wonderful, the best I've seen in the area so far! Impressive entrance, spacious charming lobby, elegant restaurants serving delicious meals, very good buffet breakfast with massive choices, 2 big swimming pools with lots of sunbeds for everyone, great spa, lovely hotel grounds and gardens, well secured and the rooms are spacious & very clean. The bed is wide & comfortable and the air-conditioning unit functions splendidly. The housekeeping staff are very courteous and checked on our rooms 2x a day altho' I must say that one or two lady receptionists at the lobby seems intimidated when spoken to in English due to their poor command of the language! Other than that, most of the staff are friendly and efficient! Our room at the 22nd floor has a balcony that provides exquisite view of the Gulf of Thailand and her long stretch of fine sandy beaches. Just crossing the street from the hotel then we're at the beach promenade, ideal for long strolls especially at night! Unlike our previous visits, Thailand this year was surprisingly much less hotter with relaxing cool breeze at night... Well this is the East Coast, I forgot, therefore cooler!

Very nice lobby - marble floors, high ceilings, the glass in the wall - all so neatly white. golden statue near parking, opposite the lifts a painting with a bicycle. If you are not near her picture taken, then consider that you are in the hotel were not. So everyone does.  In hotels no room with 2 beds. No talk room. However, when they showed the other room, we saw that floor of rooms with double beds were free. So there have occupied the Chinese who came after us. And as we all kept waiting for 14:00 - the standard.  We were given a room with one bed and put an extra couch. Do you want to sleep separately sleep like that.  This is despite the fact that booked a month in advance and pre-pay it and still.  Deposit $ 100.  Wi fi fee. Cost crazy. The plane is cheaper to buy.  In the morning at breakfast eat all the Chinese. If you come for breakfast at 9:50 am that the restaurant is closed and all the tables cleaned.  Near the pool loungers are constantly wet, because they are splashes of jumping into the water the Chinese. Pool towels are not known where.  The only advantage - great view from the balcony. We lived on the 29th floor and the view was simply stunning. By the way the chairs on the balcony, we had 2! How to turn the light on it - we have not figured out.

The wait was worth it the room was beautiful and the view was really amazing , all standard itneraries in place and a very comfortable bed alongwith a really neatly priced mini bar.    Although TV was one thing that disappointed me , i was expecting rather a LED or LCD definitely not a conventional TV with few channels    In morning the breakfast was excellent with very good food options and the security of the hotel was nice,    There were two swimming pools both good, although spa is an open spa but is great.    Location of the hotel is however a bit far off but when we Got to the main road wee easily got a taxi to the walking street area which would cost around 200 baht , there is a seven eleven just close to the hotel near the beach so no problem in getting the daily needs.    Overall a good hotel, although should have more food options in Indian food, room service is nice and food is good in taste and quality.    I would say again it's a bit far off from main area but a perfect hotel for couples Roninsworld2010 wrote a review Jan 2013\n"

The building is very well kept and very nice.Reception very very nice.I took a sea view room.The bathroom needs some refreshment., but the room was nice, very well kept and clean.Air conditioning very good and almost no noise, as the compressor was on the terrace.Welcome drink offered by the lady in charge when I arrived.Check in very quick and room given in a few minutes.Breakfast very very nice, with a lot of all you might wish.It is completely self service though.. even coffee you have to take by yrself.but that is no problem.Bars, restaurants,internet are pricey.. but as the price of the room was very reasonable, i did not care.Maybe I was lucky, but never had problems with lifts ( a couple of lifts is reserved from floors 20 to 30 ) and never had problems with russian tourists.they were the majority, in reality, but they did not disturb at all.two swimming pools.but not very deep.free towels for the swimming pools and free towels for the beach (before 10.00)..Beach is a little disappointing..just a few metres wide.But umbrellas and deck chairs are very cheap. 10 bath each.taxi from airport 1500 baths.. taxi from hotel to airport 1000 bath.It is very easy to take a tuk tuk to pattaya for 10 bath.plenty of them in both directions.Finally, I would go to this hotel again.Thanks again to the lady in charge of the reception staff.She did her best.The staff actually need a better english knowledge..but it was acceptable after all astraitaly wrote a review Jan 2013\n",
      "50 Very good hotel We lived in this hotel during two nights and after it I can said that it was beautiful days and nigths for us! Very welcoming and friendly staff, good English speaking, lovely clean and comfortable rooms, great views of the sea from the deluxe room - these are not simply words. The apparent advantage is the location of the hotel and a good price. We loved the varied breakfast.  The one and only drawback was insanely expensive paid wi-fi. Василий wrote a review Dec 2012\n",
      "50 Excellent location and helpful staff We were on family vacation in Pattaya and wanted to stay at the hotel located in Jomtien Beach. I am glad that we choose Furama Jomtien Beach resort which is located just a stone throw away from the 'cleanest' beach in pattaya.    Since I was travelling with my parenets, I wanted to ensure that they get good spacious room with sea facing balcony. Days before the check-in I got in touch with Mr. Saksith Buathong, Manager in the hotel who was very courteous and helpful. He allocated the room which made our stay even more enjoyable. He patiently answered all my queries with regards to the available rooms. On our arrival, Mr Siwanut E (front office staff), showed us our room and allowed my parents to rest while I completed the check-in process in the lobby.    Room was spacious and has excellent sea veiw from the balcony. View of sun rise and sun set over the sea is something that stay with you for long. Breakfast was good & menu variety was wide.    As for the location of the hotel, beach is just accross the road! Beach chair on this beach is also reasonable costing 30 Baht/chair. There was no trouble in finding the local thai food as there are several resturants & local food vendors near the hotel. Even Seven-Eleven store & other shops such as Pharmacy, travel agents are located nearby. Major advantage for us was that this place is away from the 'maddening' crowd and most of the tourist here were with family. Travelling to other places in Pattaya was also not a problem as it is easy to find 'baht Bus' which usually stand opposite the hotel.    I would definitely like to stay here again and would recommend this hotel, specially to people on family vacation. moday wrote a review Nov 2012\n",
      "40 Beautiful sea view and great hotel but disappointing staff Located at a great location in Pattaya, a few steps to the Jomtien beach. Away from the city hustle-bustle. The hotel is well-designed and looks classy. They have 2 pools, very clean and well-maintained. The rooms were very clean and I loved the view from the balcony of our room. Beautiful sea-view and sun-set view. You would feel that its worth the money you paid.  The breakfast buffet menu is wide and good. They have a few resturants within and coffee shop too. The tours agent, bars, massage parlour, grocery shop, medical shop is right next to the hotel and as a traveller, I dont think you have to search and travel far for anything. The tuk-tuk can take you to the walking street or any prime part of the city for only 10 Baht. Trust me, you would make a wise choice if you choose your stay here.  Not to miss, they had organised a Halloween party too during our stay. Though not many turned up at the party but it was well planned and arranged.  But as ever, you would have a few set-backs. The hotel seems to be over-crowded at all times. You will find people everywhere, whether you are in lobby, spa, resturant or pool, you will find atleast 50 people at all times. The staff, especially the reception staff are so occupied managing check-ins and check-outs that they dont even bother to listen to what you have to stay. The most disappointing part was the check-out when the receptionist guy was not even courteous to say `Thanks` or `Hello`. He made us feel that he gave us a free stay here. Grrr!  But ignoring the staff, an excellent hotel or the best hotel at Jomtien beach area. VIJAY K wrote a review Nov 2012\n",
      "20 Horrible I and my wife visited the hotel, supposed to be a Four Star Hotel, not even a single feature you have of that sort. The reception counter is worst of that lot its so dirty filled with dust i dont know how people work over there, secondly the reception counter is very slow in their work, thirdy the doors of the rooms are not coloured properly lots of scratches fourthly the bath tub is outdated. The best things of this hotel are Nice Lift Service and Big Rooms, Great Buffet Breakfast but could be better prashantkamble646 wrote a review Nov 2012\n",
      "20 Nice view but I wouldn't pay to stay there. I went to the hotel for a seminar, so I did not pay. You might say this does not give me the right to comment. That is your opinion, I stayed there for a week so I think I do have the right.  My room was on the 29th floor and in my seminar there where at least 150 people. Everyday when we finished we had to wait 30 mins to get upstairs. As there are only 3 elevators going all the way up. And 2 going to the 5 th floor. These elevators broke down continuously. Some of us started using the service elevators and then one of them broke down too and was not repaired by the time we left. I must say that the room was clean to begin with but that the bath was not cleaned daily. Also I hung my towel up to use again and it was still removed. My biggest peeve was that you had to pay around 100baht for 30 mins worth of wi fi. Whereas I have stayed in various hotels in Thailand and never had to pay, let alone be charged an arm and a leg for Internet access. The breakfast was ok if you went for bacon and eggs. The thai food they offered could have been nicer. The view was spectacular but as we spent about an hour a day (while the sun was up) in our rooms, so this was not enough to make me want to go back.

      "40 Pattaya Furama hotel few steps to Jomtien beach just across the road and you there,,,The hotel was nice the crew were friendly , I booked the hotel wit out breakfast because in Pattaya I will not be able to return to your room before 5am,,,,,so There was 2 swimming pool in a hotel well nice and clean,,,,,,the restaurants looks good I guess the y are a bit expensive but in general the hotel was value for the money I paid.    The only thing is the hotel location is a bit far from Pattaya walking street which's not a big issue 20 baht and you there. WENA298570 wrote a review Oct 2012\n"

      "10 The terrible hotel with a good view Furama hotel has a wonderful view of the beach. From the room I can watch the great view of sunrise and sunset. But, the room isn't in so good condition. The light controller beside the bed all can't use. The pillow seems like melting when I put my head on it. The air con is so noisy that we can't sleep. The balcony is quite dangerous because its fence is too short. If you are careless, it's possible for you to fall down.    The service is OK for Thai guests. When we asked the housekeeper or the receptionist for some information, they are pleased to answer . However, when the foreigners asked them some questions, they seem like can't understand what the foreigners say.    The cleanliness is the most terrible point. The swimming pool are full of sand and rubbish. The dish and kitchenware are so dirty.    Breakfast is also bad. Food taste is so terrible. Emiko S wrote a review Oct 2012\n",

      "30 Impressive structure and view - but not great rooms The room we stayed in had a great view of the Jomtien Beach. I think nearly all rooms have a good view of the beach. However, the rooms (and bathroom) and the general up-keep of the hotel is not great. Somehow, the rooms do not live up to the impressive structure of the hotel and is disappointing.    It is not very close to the main city/Walking street. But, this is only an issue in case of really late nights, since you have share cabs to the city all other time. They cost you 10 THB per passenger, irrespective of where you get in and where you get off. If you need to book a whole cab for yourself, then is generally costs about 150 THB.    The advantage of it being outside the city is that its more relaxed and quieter.    However, given the poor quality of the rooms, I would not recommend the Hotel. ManuelJ wrote a review Sep 2012\n",
      "20 Nice sea view | Away from crowds | Horrible maintenance & staff All the rooms are designed to have a very good view of the sea. There is a pool at the 5th floor that has fabulous views. Location is also great - away from the noisy Pattaya crowd. However its not a great place for night activities.    Staff are very impolite - most of them do not understand English. Customer service is totally absent. Lot of Russian tourists here - does not have a Thai ambience!    Worst part is the maintenance of the rooms. Curtains are torn & toilets have mildew growing. Cleaning standards are very poor. The photos shown are very deceptive. Only the larger suites at the end of hallway are newly refurbished & photographed.    With a plethora of choices in Pattaya, this hotel is easily worth skipping. Kumaresh_sekaran wrote a review Sep 2012\n",
      "10 WORST HOTEL EVER Don't ever go near this place, not only is it run down and shabby but they tend to attack guests that disagree with them after a serious accident ...... 9 on 1 the following is what happend : My wife and I were standing on the balcony, she turn to walk to the bathroom her elbow strikes the glass door, this subsequently collapses showering her with shards of glass making her fall with large shards of glass stuck in her thigh, shoulder and right arm / hand. I immediately phoned reception and started on 1st. aid as she was bleeding a lot, no help came so I wrapped a towel around my hand and broke the largest shard in her thigh so I could carry her to the bed. I then phoned the reception again asking for help, and then started bandaging her wounds with strips of towels at this point thankfully the people staying next door had heard the yelling and crying and came to help, taking my son to their room so he didnt have to witness more of the carnage, as they got back to their room they to called the reception asking that help be sent. Finally some staff ( a receptionist and a security guard) arrived as the receptionist hurried to help me with the first aid, the security guard was more occupied taking pictures of the room, balcony and my wife who had no clothes on (unless you count the bandages I constructed as clothes) and did not quite understand why I objected to him taking pictures of her. I carried her downstairs and an ambulance arrived and we were taken to the emergency room on Pattaya-Bangkok hospital. 5½ hr later and 74 stitches, 14 staple's and 94000 thb poorer we returned to the hotel to enjoy our last 4 days of the stay in Jomtien, we were after much discussion and after promising to pay for the new room moved to another room, as our old room was full of blood and shards of glass. 4 days later we checked out and not only did we have to pay for another room, we were charged for the towels I had used for bandages and the bedding that she had dared to bleed on, when i protested about that I was manhandled by a bellboy, and when he found out really wasn't up to the task he called in 8 others and proceeded to try to beat me up infront of a crying wife and child fortunately some friends of ours arrived to pick us up at that moment and seeing that not only was I not alone anymore, but my wife had started filming the attack with her iPhone they stopped instead they blocked the way so our friends car couldnt leave before we had payed the extra money demanded. The incident is now in the hands of a Thai lawyer and the police and we're told that it is a good case and that chances are good that there will be some sort of compensation for her. I'm putting in a picture of how our room looked after the accident, don't look at it if you can't stand blood. Jakob_W_Andersen wrote a review Sep 2012\n",
      "30 Comfortable hotel at a nice peaceful beach Comfortable hotel with nice pools, good sea view and is away from the normal crowded beaches of pattaya.    Was there for a 2day 1 night stay, love the view of the pool and the sea view. The beach is not fantastic and the waves are strong, but when you are looking out at the sea from 24 floor. Is Fantastic.  So if you like high floor request for it, I booked through Agoda and was told that I am given 4th floor. When I wanted higher floor they charged me extra US$15    The breakfast is reasonable, standard hotel food. Maybe coz is not the weekend yet, the floor I was only has less then 30% occupancy.    OOh they actually gave me a toothbrush box with out the toothbrush inside !! Rakafet wrote a review Sep 2012\n",
      "30 Nothing too special. Average is exactly the right word for this hotel. On the good side we have the view, quiet rooms, closeness to the beach, the pools and the breakfast. On the bad side we have general disrepair, a real lack when it comes to details, not a lot to do within walking distance and a hotel that has never been completed.

      "30 In Need for Upgrade The view was nice and location was good since it's near the beach, but the room was poorly furnished and old. Renovation is necessary, I think. Staffs were okay, but not really attentive. They had good selection of breakfast though. Overall, this was not I'd expect from a 4-stars hotel as it's more likely a 2 or 3 stars.

      "30 Great Sea Views, quiet location, hotel needs renovation Stayed at Furama for 3 nights, fantastic sea views, hotel room good size but average decor showing signs of age. The hotel is located in a quiet location of Jomtien beach. Staff ok but need to be up-trained to become more productive and attentive to customer needs. As a general observation the hotel decor and furniture is showing signs of age and needs an upgrade and some re-planning, there are huge dead spaces on ground floor that gives an empty and deserted feel to the hotel. The Swimming pools on ground and fifth floors are clean and the pool service good. Overall the hotel lacks atmosphere, has no deicated bar or entertainment and has only one out of three restaurants remain open. There is a very limited hotel shop with very few essentials on sale, again dissapointing. The gym is currently closed for renovation until Novemeber, very dissapointing for a hotel of this caliber. Bottom line very average and not quite what I expected from the Furama Brand of hotels. Peter J wrote a review Aug 2012\n",
      "30 Quite good, something need to be improved Location was OK just across the road to the beach. Nice and cozy lobby area. Room was also nice and clean, though a little bit old. Only problem in the room for me, there was no lamp provided at the desk. As I was on a business trip so it was important. I had to use the lamp on the bedside table. I like the balcony that looking out to the beach. Television in my room was quite an old-fashioned type, but I really don't mind as I don't like watching TV programs and hadn't much time to. I slept well at night, there was no sound or noise.    But there was a little chaos at the breakfast. Soooo many guests, there weren't enough seats and staff weren't so helpful in finding us some seats. The tables were left with pile of dishes. When my friends and I managed to find ourselves a clear table , there were no cuttlery provided. The staff were too busy to notice us, we helped ourselves in everything. Choice of meals were too less. Food taste ok, nothing so impressive.  The hotel really need to improve services at the breakfast and provide the desk lamp. Sizzi wrote a review Aug 2012\n"

      "30 Expected Better Furama Jomtien is the tallest building in Jomtien beach area and that certainly gives an advantage of panoramic view, especially on the high floor.    The staff, especially at the reception and front door, are friendly, helpful and attentive. The decoration around the lobby area is also modernly romantic.    The room, however, has some problem with being a high-rise building next to the ocean. The glass door to the room's balcony always hit its frame and making a noise when the wind blows (which happens every second as it is next to the beach). That is a big problem to those who have a hard-time sleeping.    Regarding room decoration, it's quite plain, nothing much. Front wooden door and wooden furniture have some scratches, but not so big deal. The bathroom has a wide windows opening to the bedroom which can give a romantic moment to the couples.    There're only 3 elevators to the high floor and they're quite slow especially before noon. Furama offers a wide range of food for Breakfast, from western to oriental cuisines, but the taste is very average. TheTas wrote a review Jun 2012\n",

      "30 Awesome sea view I guess it's one of the best sea view on Jomtien, especially if you take high floor. But no furniture on a balcony, which is some odd, but you can use room chairs.  Room is ok, I like glass-wall bathroom, swimming pool is clean, they sale some snakes and drinks.  Minus - they have lots of Russians, very slow lift and nothing so special, except view from balcony.  If you really care about room view - it's a right place for you, but if not - there are lots of other options in Jomtien and Pattaya. Katerina wrote a review May 2012\n",
      "20 Disappointed. Disappointed, the location is good.Firstly when we checked , the process is too long. Reception including the staff at the front house, talk so much . Everyone has their mobiles put on the counter. That makes not professional. Including duty manager same thing as them. The staff never eyes contact. Always put their eyes on the com while talking. So it makes me disappoing while i asked anything. Feel like disturbing them when they were playing internet even FB. The room was so dirty. The head shower was broken before we checked in, but never fixed. I called reception said , please called again because the engineer not around. So much disappoint. I needed to follow the thing by ourselves. Not them, about room service. So bad service. We ordered room service. When we had finished the meal, we called them to pick up. They said please wait.but until we checked out Did not someone to clear. We slept with smell of food. So bad reception. We also work the hotel. Been stayed many hotels. But this hotel need to prove their service. The hotel is a chain one. Its good and popular. If the hotel never change the habit of reception even Duty Manager, many tons of complaint waiting for u. Duty manager never showed himself the high level. Just like normal reception. Reception spoke the messed around. It not good for us to hear , we are THAI . They spoke Thai. So disappoint of this hotel.. KrispyKreme_yummy wrote a review May 2012\n",
      "30 One of the newest and cleanest hotels at Jomtien, not speaking of Pattaya I've stayed here for few days at the end of April for a family reunion.All the rooms are with sea view and top floors are preferrable, the hotel is relatively new but unfortuntly the rooms are quitte shabby already. The hotel pool is quite nice, not private beach though which is a disadvantage, having the sea just across the road. Room Service menu and downstairs CoffeeShop selection are quite good both quality -and price-vise.  The hotel spa is awul and practically doesn't exist, since there's just a receptionist taking orders and calling in specialists from the city that may no show up at all after an hour wait and\\or do you a completely different procedure without prior notice ( which happened to us), plus they demand cash, since it's being operated independently from hotel ( no room charge is possible).

      "40 Good price and view!! I stayed in this hotel in superior room with my friend. In Agoda web-site, they say about this room type that there is partial sea view. In fact, there is a condominium beside the hotel but it does not affect the sea view on my room (902). The bed is comfy and good as a standard. Although the building and overall facilities are quite old, this hotel could be a good choice in Pattaya for budget travellers.    Last time I came here with my family and stayed in the two bedroom suite (room number one but I can remember what exactly the floor). Very good price for this suite type in Pattaya area but it may not too much luxury. Kong10 wrote a review Apr 2012\n",

Breakfast was plentiful with lots of choices. However it was extremely busy especially at weekend, & although staff cleared away quickly, they were never able to replenish table settings.  The 2 pools had very ordinary surroundings. Ok for the price, but would probably choose somewhere else next time. Availability was limited in Pattaya at the time of year.

      "40 Great view of ocean, clean accommodation I have stayed here twice over the last 12 months and thinking of staying here again soon. The view from the room and balcony is awesome - seeing the sunset over the ocean is very special. The accommodation is first class. However, it is a bit pointless having a balcony without any balcony furniture - means you can't sit outside and enjoy the view. However, you can drag their inside furniture outside if you want to make the effort - probably worth it for a sit out on the balcony watching the life go by on the ocean :-)  Breakfast is quite good, but very busy as the hotel attracts large numbers of Eastern European and Russian tour groups - these people should be taught to respect the Thai culture by dressing more modestly in the hotel lobby (come on guys, wearing only speedos - and especially when you're built like an elephant - is highly inappropriate and offensive in the lifts and hotel lobby).

Excutive suite was spacious, but in the beginning we were not satisfied with the bathroom interior so we insisted to have something better - after some negotiations we upgraded the room a bit better (room 2310). This is very spacious having a glass wall to the sea and jacuzzi of course. Wonderfull room!    Executive lounge was operating with excellent service (free beverages and beer with some salad and sushi). The staff in general was extremely nice and polite.    Breakfast was more than generous: thai and european with rich variety. No rush at least before 8:00.    Location is pretty ok - if you need to go some elswere the songthaew costs only 10-40 baht (= nothing) depending how far. There are a lot of restaurants and cafes in the neighbourhood.

      "20 Two Stars is a Generous Rating The pictures looked great and the price seemed too good to be true. Turned out, it was. The service was awful from the first time we walked through the door. The staff was unfailingly rude and unhelpful. They were always out of towels at the pool and for the beach. You only got about 5 minutes of hot water in the shower. And the cable kept going out. The AC is poor and the rooms are small and not very clean. And why have ocean view balconies when you're too cheap to furnish them?    The buffet breakfast and beach access (albeit Jomtien rather than the main Pattaya beach) raise this to a grudging second star rating. And Jomtien is better for families (especilly Russians) than the main drag (pun intended). But if you want ready access to the real Pattaya scene, stay on Pattaya Beach and avoid this dump.

      "10 I would never stay here again. My family and I stayed here because it was decided by our tour company. We checked this place out online and it looked amazing but that is as far as it goes. The lobby was gorgeous and I must say the bell staff was really nice. We had a nice room with a really nice view of the beach. Upon entering in the room I did notice cracks/holes in the hall walkway, which I also mentioned to my husband \"that's an accident, waiting to happen.\" Room was nicely decorated.    What really made me dislike this place was the management staff and how they handle discrepancies. One of days my husband was sick and he had drank two bottle of water from the mini-bar. Upon checking-out at the front desk, we made sure to reconcile all the charges on the room. My family and I had waited for our tour guide for about 30 minutes in the hotel lobby, upon which he double check with the front deck to make sure everything was reconciled with our room too. On our way back to Bangkok, an hour into our drive, the hotel calls our tour guide complaining that we did not pay for our 2 waters (which cost us 80 baht= $2 or $3 USD). They wanted us to return to the hotel to give them the money. Our guide told them that we were over an hour away asked for the hotel to bill the tour company and they will pay the amount, which we then gave him the money to pay for the water, because really, what is $3 on vacation. If that wasn't really weird enough, they called our tour guide THREE more times to throughout the day to make sure they will get their money.    All I have to say is customer service is EVERYTHING!!!! SoCalMSmith wrote a review Sep 2011\n",
      "50 'nice place and friendly staff' Not my first time to visit Pattaya and I like to stay at Jomtien beach side which it's not much busy as pattaya beach.This time round I choose this hotel to stay as for trying the services of this hotel and it's really makes me want to go back there again. Staffs very friendly with warm welcome smiles and the careness action of them make me feel like my own home. I have got escort by Ms Supranee with her warm welcome smile and professional. I do really like this place. Tpan wrote a review Sep 2011\n",

      "50 My second time and good to be back Have stayed at this hotel last year. A great place to relax around one of two pools in the hotel. The staff are very friendly and polite, the rooms are large, bright and are all air conditioned and look out to the ocean. I would like to say a very special thank you to James the duty manager of the hotel who was very helpful and courteous when dealing with him Solotraveler1044 wrote a review Aug 2011\n",
      "30 Great view is the beginning and end of this place I love a good sunset and this is the place to see it. Most all rooms face the water over Jomtien Beach so you get a wonderful look. The pool is big yet uqiet. Of course the beach is right across the street.    The service was very poor. They seem to be not want you to stay there. I walked up to the counter about four times and they spent more time talking to eachother than me :(    The room was fine. arizonaac wrote a review Aug 2011\n",
      "50 Great View, Great Breakfast, Great Customer Service! My partner and I have been traveling for 4 months now and by far Furama has been the best value. Averaging nightly rate about $65USD booked thru Hotels.com. We came to Jomtien Beach instead of Pattaya because we heard that it is more LBGT/family friendly away from the sexpat community, which is what we have found at this hotel. We mostly saw families and kids around the hotel.    The positives -  -The deluxe room view was absolutely breathtaking! We were on the 23rd floor and from the inside of our room we could see the vastness of the water and the full moon beaming right before sunrise. Each room seems to also come with a balcony with chairs and a table to sit and relax. Very romantic!  -The room was spacious and clean. No sight of bugs or mosquitoes! No odd smells, everything worked.  -The hotel has two large swimming pools on the 1st and 5th floors with plenty of chairs to lay out.  -The breakfast buffet had plenty of asian and western options with some changes daily.  -The staff had also surprised my girlfriend with a cake for her birthday, compliments of the hotel! We didn't even tell the hotel that it was her bday but they must have paid attention during our check-in process. Very nice!  -Hotel has Seafood bbq buffet on the weekends and it was delicious and not too overpriced for all the variety it offers.  -Free ice cold juice and water in the lobby with the type of juice changing daily. Very refreshing after spending time on the hot beach!    The negatives- Just two.  -Wifi was available only at a cost. We paid for the 1 day use for 300 Baht.  -The fitness center was a bit lacking with only 1 treadmill.    Other than that, we would definitely come back to Furama again!

      "30 Only go here if you get sick deal. And I mean siiiick. The Furama is a clean modern up-to-date facility that is okay in and of itself. The rooms are nice and food delicious. The problem comes with its location. It is about a mile away from Pattaya beach where all the action is. Song Tews are cheap and can be easily hired for about 20 baht a person, but why bother when you have a slew of other options on Pattaya beach. Jomtien is some how strangely known to have better beaches but this is simply not true. None of the beaches around Pattaya are clean enough for anyone to have a clean swim. To get to a Phuket-like tropical experience, you must take a ferry to Ko Lan island, which is amazing. To take advantage of Ko Lan, get a ghotel as close to Walking Street as possible, as the ferry terminal at the end of the street. Jomtien is simply not worth it unless you get an incredible deal that is enough to offset your hassle with hiring Song Tews. donSeoul_SouthKorea wrote a review Aug 2011\n",
      "20 Seaview from the room is great, the rest is shocking... The only good thing about this hotel is the great seaview from the balcony. But other than that, the services and room conditions are shockingly disappointed. Normally I do not complain much but this hotel is clearly understaffed and the rooms are in poos, decaying conditions. The exterior looks nice with new paint though which can be deceiving.    We arrived at this hotel by my own car. There was no sign showing where parking lot. 3 hotel security officers pointed us to different directions and I had to make u-turns 3 times before figured out where the underground parking was. The underground parking was dark, scary, and full of junks and construction materials. We had to carry our own bags to the lobby by stairs with no help from staffs. The reception gave us 2 key cards to open the door. No bellboy to us with bags and nobody to show you the room. We had to figure out how to use the key card by ourselves just to find out that one of the cards didn't work. We asked the reception if there was an elevator that goes down to the underground parking or any other passage, he pointed us to a 'staff only' door that led us down into a tunnel maze with pipes and construction debris. We didn't want to continue walking further because things started getting scary, dark and silent so we headed back with weird feeling why he let us come down this way... Saw a female reception yelling at a Russian guest who couldn't speak English and tried asking for help because his key card didn't work.    We booked a superior room with double bed but found the room was twin. Had to ask the reception to change the room. Both rooms we went inside had \"old\" hotel smell which was not very pleasant. The room was clean although furniture show heavy wear. The toilet was dark and small. Bath tub's finish was flaking and red rust ran down from the stainless steel part of the tub. No bathroom's floor mat was found in our room. The door to balcony was old and difficult to open. At night, the strong wind from the sea made loud banging sound on the door. We couldn't sleep well because it sounded like somebody was banging the door all the time although we knew it's nobody there. The 2nd night there was even worse. Stronger banging sound and black out at 3AM. It scared the hell out of my wife.    The breakfast was good with variety of food and enough for all guests. As many reviews here said, most guests here are either Russians or Chinese. I have no bias/discrimination against them so we didn't find that a problem during our stay.    Both swimming pools were ok, especially the one on 5th floor which has great sea view. But when we were in the pool on the first floor, we felt the water wasn't clean with some weird yellow.. sponge.. floating around the edge... We didn't want to stay there long. Most fitness machines were broken and nothing like their photo on the website.    Give 2 out of 5 stars because we got a good deal on agoda website. Only 40 USD a night including tax & breakfast. We called the hotel to check the price and on the telephone, they quoted 80 USD. We would be very furious if we paid 80 for this experience.    In summary, once a great hotel that's now decaying badly. Very little to no support from staffs. great sea view from balcony. away from noisy pattaya. At this hotel, ***you're on your own*** The price was good enough that we didn't want to expect more. Will we come back again? I will have to think very very hard... There are many other options.

      "10 The bad points kept on stacking up I would not normally be bothered by some of the trivial things I have listed below but they just kept stacking up.    The good points are the swimming pools and the view.    The bad points :-    1 - Half the staff are unhelpful, disinterested or plain rude.    No one took us to our room, nor did they they bother explaining the lift/elevator system, or offered to help despite watching us dragging our luggage around trying to find its location.    I called reception about the shuttle to town centre and was transferred mid sentence to be told it's a free service and leaves 8PM every evening. Ah I thought finally a redeeming feature. Can I use it tonight I asked \"IT FULL\" was the kurt reply. OK what about tomorrow ? \"IT FULL\" and the next night? \"IT FULL WE BUSY YOU GET TAXI\" line goes dead. I never called nor asked the hotel for any help or advice again.    2 - I strongly suspect the sheets had some kind of biting insects in them (they did not look 100% clean. we got up the first morning feeling itchy by the second day we had tiny bites over our bodies. when we moved hotels the cleared up.    3 - this hotel is far from everything and the additional transport costs add up quickly.    We booked the \"Deluxe\" Sea View room. Luckily I made a mistake when booking and accidentally hit 3 nights instead of 7. I could not wait to get out and spent the following 4 nights in a cheap hotel and had a great time. cynic225 wrote a review Jul 2011\n",
      "30 Good value hotel in a nice location, breakfast was substandard though We stayed here for 1 night and had a very enjoyable stay overall. Staff were pleasant, friendly and attentive, and the very smooth check-in process was excellent. Our bags followed us up to the room in good time, and were loaded into our car for us upon check-out .    The room was spacious, well appointed and had a great view of Jomtien beach. Bathroom facilities were all clean and in good working order. The huge bed was very comfortable.    Location, for me, was good - away from the main town so was a bit quieter, and had a nice stretch of beach in front (well, nice by Pattaya standards anyway).    We enjoyed the seafood buffet in the evening which was very good, and well priced at 650 Baht NET.    However, I found the breakfast a bit disappointing. There was a very substantial buffet, but around 80% of the food was geared towards Asian guests: fried chicken, curry, etc. which I can't imagine many Europeans going for. The European food that was there was mainly quite poor, with things like cold fried eggs and boiled frankfurter-style sausages and ham, which are the hallmark of lower 3 star breakfast buffets in Thailand, and not what you expect from a place which is touting itself as 4 star. Bread was of the cheap 7-11 variety. Coffee was only instant coffee - again, not what you expect from a 4 star establishment. Worse was the fact that they had an espresso machine in one corner of the breakfast room - when I asked for a coffee from this machine I was told that there would be a charge of 110 Baht, and that only Nescafe was included with breakfast. Not really 4 star service!    But, apart from this, the hotel was good on the whole and decent value for the price dantilley wrote a review Jun 2011\n",
      "30 what ever shines is not gold !! booked this hotel by doing search online , the pics looked awesome and the building also promised to be nice and huge .  the lobby of the hotel was ok , but the staff was not very friendly as they didnt know how to communicate in english and very not helpful in giving 2 rooms together on same floor .  the downside of this hotel is location its too far from the main area of pattaya , the walking street or the main beach area , if you are looking for a quiete area with beach then its fine else i wouldnt recommend this hotel, the taxi guys wont go to furama as it was far or would charge double the money,  the breakfast buffet was also not great ,mostly japanese or korean kind of food , too less option for vegeterians. ahuja02 wrote a review Jun 2011\n"

      "10 DON'T STAY HERE (inconvenient location, trashy guests, overpriced) This place is on the decline and far too expensive for what one gets. What DO you get for your money? 1) a place mobbed with rude, low-economic-bracket Russian tourists that displayed farmyard manners at the mediocre breakfast, 2) a location at the far southern end of Jomtien Beach, requiring a long \"Baht-Bus\" trip to the center of Pattaya (and the fare for returning to the hotel in the evening is 3 or 4 times more expensive, given its remoteness), 3) hotel staff that were quite incompetent and front-desk staff that additionally had a burned out indifference (no doubt from being buffeted by the masses of visitors), 4) a crowded, un-charming beach, 5) interruptions by maid service, 6) erroneous mini-bar fees (which we finally gave up and paid just to get out of there). professor-type wrote a review Mar 2011\n",

      "40 They could easily improve a few things After reading other reviews I would have to say you get what you pay for, but the chain could improve on so many things. Comparing the Furama to other hotels in the area, it is much cheaper and still a great find. But it was the little things that disappointed me.    The European breakfast buffet had a very limited selection with the exact same bland selections every day. There was no cheese, which greatly disappointed me and the bread selection was terrible.    If you are looking for a clean hotel that is off the main beach, away from all of the action for a few days of R&R this is not a bad option. However if you are looking for an alternative to the Hilton or Marriott I suggest you look elsewhere. You should probably brush up on your Russian as well as the hotel had a 90% Russian occupancy rate due to a group tour agreement of some sort. Big AL wrote a review Jan 2011\n",
      "30 Long way to the Furama level... I am sorry, my review is not objective . We booked Executive club room and we were free upgraded to the 2 rooms executive suite, so we got more, then we paid for. The central suite was beautifull, with huge balcony, reconstructed bathroom, nice furniture. For 3000 bahts per night it was fantastic. But it is all positive  Now negatives ...the first room, where we were for 10 minutes was realy substandard - if I compared it with other hotels in this price range in Thailand, my english is not very good, but the english of front desk staff was realy poor - maybe they are better in russian, no bell boys to help you with your suitcases, nobody help you to find room and right elevator.  Hotel is not able to secure sleeping in nights for guests- some boys at the close beach - no more then 10 of them have 10000 watts amplifiers in their pick-up cars and loud bass music untill 4:00AM was horribille. When I call to the reception - young man asks me \"What can we do?\"  This is not Furama - if it wants to be one of them, it must go a long and painfull way to reach it.

      "30 good location but everything else is below average We booked this hotel for the location as it's on Jomtien beach, not very far from Jomtien Center.  The Hotel looks very nice from outside but everything else inside is very substandard.  Right from the beginningm when there was no one to offload our lugagge into luggage trolleys to asking for room service / housekeeping services.  Check in was very confusing as they have mostly temperory staff and for every query, they tell you to wait a minute and go and check with their superiors.  After checking into the Executive Twin Room, we were told that we can't use the Executive lounge. I still don't know the reason why.  Anyways, the telephonic assistance, be it room service or house keeping don't understand any english and it can be quite a pain when you get locked into your room as the electronic lock is malfunctioning.  In a snapshot:  Why avoid:  1. Bad fitness centre: really bad with broken machines  2. Old rooms  3. no personalised service or reasonably good english understanding staff.    Why go:  1. It has 2 swimming pools which looked good but when you are 50 mtrs away from beach, you don't care for that. gary25 wrote a review Jan 2011\n",
      "10 Number 1 unfriendly hotel in Pattaya I booked this hotel on Expedia for a very good price, for myself and two grandchildren, 7 and 11. I have stayed many times in Thailand in various hotels from 5* to 2* and have never experienced the total lack of service or guest relations from reception staff.  On checking in, there were no staff on desk, finally found one and checked in, there were no bell boys and I had to ask for some help with all luggage. I was given key cards for room but had no idea which floor or lift to use ( different lifts for various floors), finally located bell boy having conversation outside in car park. On reaching my room I would give it 10 out of 10, it was a suite with a large balcony and was very clean. The breakfast was not very good,toaster only toasted one side of bread,coffee lukewarm and found it difficult to get seat, after a couple of days I gave up and we bought provisions and ate in our room, which had a large fridge to store our food in.  The children loved the pool on 5th floor, while not very big, they had great fun and the pool staff were the only ones to acknowledge us with a good morning! A shortage of mattresses on the sun beds was the only fault with the pools.  The noise from outside the hotel was horrendous, nearly every night locals would park along the beach road with the loudest bass boxes and speakers from their vehicles booming out, this could go on til 4am and prevented sleep. Also Friday and Saturday nights the hotel has its own bar blasting dance music out, to the one or two people who were there, again resulting in children unable to sleep.  I have stayed on Soi 8 in Pattaya during New Year and had better sleep quality !!!  Our of the 16 nights we stayed there only once did another guest speak to us, they were from Norway , although the hotel was nearly full, the majority of guests were Russian or east european and unfortunately contributed to the unfriendly feel of this hotel  We did find a lovely beach man,opposite the pizza cafe along the beach road who could not have done more for us, even giving us a lift back to the hotel on his bike !!  I would not recommend this hotel.    . taxigirl06 wrote a review Jan 2011\n",

      "30 Far away from the Thai hospitality that we are used to an average hotel in the quieter area, guests mainly Russians    Good things:  - very nice view from the balcony  - room service food excellent  - quiet area, no thai ladies/ladyboys around selling their services  - swimming pools are nice althought not that many seats available    Bad things:  - bad service  - hotel staff don't speak English - even the hotel room number is hard to understand. Staff maybe speaks Russian as the majority of guests are Russians (more than 90%)  - we stayed in an executive suite and none of the exclusive services mentionned on the webpage were available (lounge, complimentary drinks, newspapers).

      "30 Great view, but not much after that! We were on our HoneyMoon and wanted a place with a good view, first off we new Pattaya/Jomtien was not exactly 'HoneyMoon' territory, but knowing Thailand we knew what to expect.  The view was spectacular, and the rooms were decent. Bummed out how expensive the Wifi was so that upset me big time. Biggest disappointment was the buffet breakfast, with all the tour groups they do, it's pretty 'blah food' and always sent me to the 'loo' soon after breakfast. Pools are nice, but overall service was fairly bad, one day they did not clean our room until 4pm. ... I had to call. Also was disappointed with their TV selection, with 30 channels available but few in English, they cater mainly to their Russian Clientele which is pretty heavy there.  The beach in front was ok, plenty of 7-11's close by to buy cheaper drinks (beer), another major bummer was it had only 3 elevators but with nearly 30 floors and alot of people, it was a major hassle after breakfast to reach your room. I would recommend this hotel only for it's view, might be better elsewhere! tboxcar wrote a review Oct 2010\n"

      "50 Pleasant Stay at Furama While booking our stay at Furama (booked by its earlier name Nusa Playa) we expected a lot looking at the exotic pictures on its website. On reaching the hotel, we were not disappointed. It is one of the most well situated hotels in Pattaya. As we entered our room on the 15th floor, the view of the sea was breathtaking.    The facilities at the hotel were as expected and the room was well equipped with everything we needed including a full sized fridge normally not found in most hotels. The service was good and people were in general courteous and helpful.    For people with growing up children, this could be one of the best choices in terms of facilities and location and of course reasonable rates. Plus its location at Jomtein beach makes it a great place for families and away from the adult attractions Pattaya is otherwise known for.    The breakfast buffet was also quite good and had a good variety to suit all tastes.    What I however, felt is that in certain areas, the maintenance could be better which would only make the experience even better. It is such a great property, if maintained well it could be a winner.

      "30 Not impressed apart from the seaview We stayed at the Furama for 3 nights in July 2010. We booked a deluxe seaview room and althought the view was amazing the room was a litle outdated nothing out of the ordinary and we have had alot better during the trip.  We preferred the pool on the ground floor which had a jacuzzi and was less busy than the other pool on the 5th floor.  A word of warning - it is my personal opinion and experience that this hotel only welcome guests of chinese/japanese/asian origin - from the moment we checked in we felt uncomfortable - almost watched at times - we are an english couple in our thirties not exactly headbangers ! the hotel wanted a 2000B deposit - i'd be interested to know if this applies to all guests - it certainly wasnt mentioned at booking.  The hotel is on the beach but at the far end of Jomtien - there is not alot of bars and restaurants around the hotel but the baht bus stops outside and it is only 10B all the way to Pattaya and stops whenever you buzz the bell - couldn't be easier or cheaper to get around.  Breakfast selection was very good and catered for all tastes. 3Seniors wrote a review Jul 2010\n",
      "40 Best deal in Pattaya, wonderfull hotel. This is my second time to Furama hotel. I find it a great hotel in a very good price. It is located on Jomtien beach road, about 2KM from Dongtan beach or the main area of hotels and restaurants. I find it a very good location, since it is much quieter here and for 10 Baht you can find yourself in the center of Jomtien, if you choose to go there. The rooms themselves are nice. Try to get to the Deluxe room which are much better than the Superior rooms. When i came, last time, i wasn't fully satisfied with my room. I asked to speak with the manager which is a very nice person. I was offered an upgrade and a free fruit basket to my new room. The hotel provides a very rich buffet style breakfast. Has 2 swimming pools, a gym. BUT the best is - every room has a balcony viewing the sea. There are no back rooms. All the rooms are facing the sea, so there are an amazing sunsets from each and every balcony. It is a 450 rooms hotel, stuff are very helpful and will do anything to make your stay enjoyable.

      "40 Group Booking in Furama We have arranged for a business trip for one of our clients from India. The group had 60 adults. We have taken 32 rooms, including for the CEO, guides and for us in this hotel. We had our room on the 18th floor and it was a spectacular view from there,. Rooms are well maintained and airy. Beds are comfortable. Breakfast was really excellent as it had loads of varieties of food. Two pools are there and we enjoyed our time.  In my opinion the points for improvement are: the exterior of the rooms (someone has already mentioned about the peeling of paints on the doors), lighting in the room is pretty dim-definitely this has to be attended to. There was a guide in the front of the hotel, with an album full of nude girls, soliciting everyone for prostitution. Agreed, Pattaya is for entertainment, but a person at the main entrance, calling everyone for a live-show is really preposterous.  Overall, we enjoyed our stay and I am looking forward to bring my family to this hotel for our next vacation. R S wrote a review Jul 2010\n",
      "30 Could have been better I recently spent four nights at the Furama Jomtien Beach hotel in Pattaya with the extended family. There were ten of us so we have five rooms during the trip.    Overall, this hotel is not deserving of the 4 stars shown under the Hotel Class on TripAdvisor. It's an ok hotel .... nothing special or to rave about.    Positives:  - Location: along the beachfront (rooms on the upper floors have awesome views). Though there's not much going on within walking distance.  - Lobby: looks nice and modern - it's nice to feel the air conditioning as you walk in from the humidity.  - Pools: two pools..with an infinity pool on the ground floor    Negatives:  - Breakfast buffet: it was included in our room rate; buffet was short on variety and what was there was not that good; tables were not cleaned quickly enough during the early morning rush - hard to find table and then find someone to clean; staff didn't seem to refill often enough or seem too happy working there.  - Elevators: there are a total of five elevators but 2 were reserved for floors 1-5 only. That meant long waits for the elevator - especially during the morning and early evening hours. Painful!  - Hotel condition: we were on the 7th floor...the hallway was open to the outside. Walls in hallway either needed a wash or new coat of paint. There seemed to be ongoing construction (but no work going on while we were there). When I looked down from the seventh floor, I could see plenty of trash on the ground below  - Room: rooms were ok - furnishings seem to be on the cheap end. (1) need more English language channels! (2) did not seem like housekeeping changed linens each day (there were sand on our sheets). kurisu99 wrote a review Jul 2010\n"

      "50 Wonderful hotel We stayed here for four nights and it was a fantastic hotel, we were waited on hand and foot, we booked over internet and it was so cheap.  The pools were lovely and very quiet when we stayed. Food was very pleasant as were the staff. Rooms were spotless.  20 bahts on a baht bus (which is fun) will get you to center of Pattaya.  This hotel is a must. lorneview1 wrote a review Jul 2010\n",
      "30 Felt like a serviced apartment The hotel felt like a serviced apartment. Perhaps the building has previously been in a residential use. The room was spacious and it was a very nice sea view from the 22nd floor. The room wasn't really cozy. Furnishing was basic but a large bed was comfortable. An A/C was noisy and a selection of English TV channels was poor. No free wi-fi and it was really overpriced.    The location is close to the beach, but better and more attractive beach area is about 2 km away. The hotel is in quiet area far from the Pattaya center. A taxi to Pattaya center costs 200 baht/one way. You can use a Baht Bus too, which is cheaper (20 - 50 baht/one way) and naturally slower because it picks up people along the way.    The hotel has also a nice pool area with two pools. A gym can't be called gym...    A staff were polite and their performance were ok. A housekeeping deserves special thanks, they did great work and our room was cleaned really well every day. CalvinHobbes wrote a review Jun 2010\n",
      "40 Nice place for New Year It was a nice stay this time we were decided at last minute to celebrate a new year eve at Pattaya most of the hotel were sell the room with compulsory gala dinner but here is not and the room was quite nice we booked standard room and get upgrade to a deluxe room with a nice sea view actually all the rooms are sea view but if you really like to enjoy the beach this may be a bit inconvenience as there is a road between hotel and the beach and front beach of the hotel have a pier for boats and it is quite a walking distance from the hotel to the beach approx 400 meters but we have a small child which mostly spent time in the room and hotel pool cause overall for us is lovely.

      "30 hotel location The hotel facilities were alright. Surrounding was good. Not so far from the beach. However, it was not that easy to find this hotel without map A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Jan 2010\n",
      "30 good for the price This hotel in my opinion is worth the price if only book through agoda because there rack rate, walk in rate or if you book directly from their webpage is just not worth the price for their standard.  I will rate this hotel to be a 3.5 star hotel and agoda's price is worth its stars. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Jan 2010\n",

      "20 A wasted attempt The hotel is still under construction in most of the locations. They charge you for internet, which is unbeleivable.  The fruits in room are served only 1st day. 2nd onwards u can simple forget that.  I think a better management can change the fortunes of the hotel. Bathrooms are new but fittings and everything dont look like of great quality , pretty plasticky. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Jan 2010\n",
      "30 new year at the Nusa The room are very comfortable and the viwe is super. Prices are expensive and the overall price quality is acceptable. Thsi should be a modern hotel but the outside unit stand on the small balcony and makes a hell of a noise - in the room it is not better. You have the choice : turn the aircxo on and don't sleep or ... The main reason to stay in the hotel is that the new years eve dinner is not mandatory. It is a consequent system of extortion that as a guest in a hotel you HAVE to pay for a diner (15.000 per couple) for a diner with an entertaintment program that is purte horror to us. It took a day resaerch to find an place that leaves it up to the guest what to do at new years eve. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Jan 2010\n",
      "30 Hotel pros and cons In my opinion this hotel is in a good quality. The hotel is very clean and new so it makes the room is so comfortable to stay. The bathroom is very clean,too. But the service such as I order somethings to eat in my room for dinner, the food was very slow to serve and the worst point is I called for so many times tell them to send somebody to clear up the plates but no response till morning, the plates were still in front of my room and so many ants were there.

      "40 FAB Holiday&Hotel generally i like this hotel so much. it look faboulous and impressive as soon as you open the door to see the blue sea at first sight. Room is clean and spacious. I also love pizza here, taste good and not too expensive but cake is another thing. Even if the swimming pool seems too small comparing with the amount of rooms but another pool is being constructed so sooner or later this hotel would make your holiday a perfect time all in all. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Oct 2009\n",
      "40 Hotel with \"private\" beach area We were served welcome drink upon our arrival. The staffs are friendly and very helpful. The hotel has a very unique building design, as the rooms are arranged all in only one row and they all have individual balcony with the sea view. The access path to the hotel room is an open area to the other back side of the hotel, this is the part that I don't really like about this hotel, it makes the hotel looks cheap, but the room and facilities are good enough and clean.  Overall it's a nice place to stay for those who like to relax and stay away from the crowd. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Sep 2009\n",
      "40 A nice hotel away from the sexindustry The hote has mutch more canges to make good bussynes onely thay need to impruve the staff. English is no problem in the hote and thay was also halpfule. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Sep 2009\n",
      "40 Excelent I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. I had good deal from Agoda and I will certainly consider using the same hotel again. It had very nice room, good sea view, goo resturant and swimming pool. Area was good and not too busy but hotel was very busy. Beach outside was perfect and used to go for good walks everyday. Frendly staff but reception are always busy with many customers. I had no complaint at all and my stay was very relaxing and enjoyable. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Aug 2009\n",
      "40 A great view but a mixed experience I had expected something more complete from a 4½ star rated hotel. The lobby was beautiful and gave a great impression, but the service and possibilities were somewhat less impressive. Noone ready to help with luggage. Check in could not handled either AmEx or Diners credit cards. The room was beautiful with a fantastic view and a great balcony, but the bathroom was more like a cheap hotel. It was small. The room had a kitchen section, so it looked as if it was originally built as a condo, but then made into a hotel.  Breakfast at the socalled Gourmet Restaurant reminded us more of a cheaper tourist hotel. The food was okay, even though quality was not high and selections not impressive. The presentation of the food was also like a cheaper tourist hotel and certainly not something you expected from a 4½ star hotel. May be it is the staff that has not yet been trained.  But because of the room and the view, it was en enjoyable stay. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Aug 2009\n",
      "20 3 stars ...?! This hotel shouldn't count as 4.5 stars.As the first beginning , the staff didn't show us the room, we have to go by ourselves, hotel has 33rd floor but with only 2 small lifts.May be this is the reason,that he can't go with us.  Breakfast is normal,no exciting ,even the cook didn't want to make a new omelet for us, just ask us to take the cold one.Well! we didn't enjoy much at the hotel but we were happy that we went to Floating market which is near by.

      "40 Great view This high rise hotel is located at Jomtien beach which is one of the best beach in Pattaya. The room is nicely arranged. What I like the most is the big balcony of Nusa Playa. I love buying seafood and set the table at the balcony for the dinner. Don't you think it is the best way of having dinner with your love one while watching the sun set together. About the parking lot, there are lots of car park slot which is safe and convenient. The Seven Eleven convenient store and the beach are located at the walking distance. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Jul 2009\n",
      "40 One of the best This high rise hotel is located at Jomtian beach which is my most favorite beach in Pattaya. The beach is at the walking distance from the hotel (about 5 minutes walk). The beautiful seaview and beach can be viewed from every room. Of course, the sunset is gorgeous from the balcony. The facility in the room is nicely arranged. Talking about security, I felt so secured staying there. The guess must have the key card in order to enter the elevator. The housekeeping had done an excellent job in cleaning the room. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review May 2009\n",
      "40 Three weeks in Nusa Playa I stayed in the hotel for 21 days when I was doing the Divemaster course in Pattaya. What I specially liked was the friendly attitude of the staff but their language skills were too limited taking into account the overall class of the hotel. I was very surprised to notice that every evening there was a man and lady (probably from the Philippines) singing in the outside restaurant. I was surprised due to the fact that the Lady could not sing at all; at least not according to the notes... I had to do some studying and I found the executive lounge on the 22nd floor a fantastic place for that. But in case Nusa Playa want to attract business people in the future, Wlan should work also in all floors. Anyhow, I'll go to Pattaya in the beginning of June and will most probably book from the same hotel again. I think Nusa Playa represents a very good value for the money.

      "30 Nusa Playa, PATTAYA Hotel Stayed at this hotel thinking the construction would be done, but still finishing needing to be done. The area is also under construction so there is some area noise. A bit far from the bar scene and hard to get a taxi without it costing an arm and a leg. Very nice pool. No gym. Rooms are nice and big with a nice balcony overlooking the sea. The bathroom needs updating. Definitely NOT 4 1/2 stars. More like 3 1/2 A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Apr 2009\n",
      "20 Noisy & Unfinised The hotel is still under construction. Only part of it opens. You could hear all the bang noise from the construction site while sitting at the balcony or inside the room. The elevator shut down once while a few guests and I were inside. It restarted itself and we came out safely by ourselves. I told the hotel but they didn't seem to care. I don't think they really noticed what just happened to us. There were a few group tours when I was there. Group tours seem to be their main customers. I wouldn't check in there if you are a couple who need a quiet and peaceful environment. I will not go back there. It should be my first and last time at Nusa Playa Hotel. A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Jan 2009\n",
      "20 Not really a hotel but serviced rooms/suites Our family stayed at Nusa Playa over the new year 2008-2009 for 11 days.    Overall we were very disappointed with this hotel and would not really recommend this hotel to anyone.    First of all I have to say that this is not really a hotel but it is serviced apartments with a small swimming pool and one restaurant. They market them selves as a luxury hotel but it has nothing with reality to do. When you look more carefully at the room description on their web page you see that it says serviced suite.    We chose this hotel on the quiet Jomtien Beach because we had young kids and did not really care about the night life. Also this seemed to be one of the few hotels that had available family rooms. We booked the hotel via the hotels internet site.    Our room was on the 8th floor with a magnificient view of the ocean and Pattaya. The hotel is built so that all rooms have an ocean view. The entrance to all the rooms is from corridors that are on the outside. This might be a problem if you are scared of hights. The corridors had a lot of spiders and geckos climbing on the walls. Our children thought it was exiting. Because of the wildlife in the corridors, we woke up one night to a mouse that was running around in our rooms. In the morning there was mouse excrement everywhere. We reported this to the reception in the morning and they brought a mouse trap to the room. Next night we woke up to the sound of the mouse that had been caught in the trap. We called the reception and they took care of the mouse. The mouse had probably come to the rooms via the holes under the kitchen sink.    The Famliy suite concisted of 3 large rooms. The word suite is misleading because the quality of the furniture and the interior decoration was below standard quality. This building is still under construction and it seems as they have run out of money at a very early construction stage. The sofas were full or strange looking dirt stains and the floors did not have any mats to isolate any sounds. The windows were very dirty and never cleaned. All the rooms did have an own flat screen tvs but the only English channels were HBO and BBC and the tv reception quality was poor. The bedrooms had very comfortable and firm beds. The bathrooms were quite tidy but smelled sewer. They had put some herb pouches here and there to try and hide the smell.    The balconies were quite nice but the balcony doors where not really any good because you could not close them tight and therefore there was an constant whining noise when it was windy outside. The building had a small outside swimming pool on the 5th floor. We went swimming there a couple of times but could not lay too long around the pool because there were no sun shades. There was as also no showers at the pool area. There was a bar at the pool area where you could walk and buy some drinks. The hotel advertises itself also as a spa but it really only has a couple of matrasses in a room by the pool area where they have some treatments. They are building a new larger pool on the first floor but looking at the pace of the couple of workers I saw there, I doubt it will be ready in many years.    The hotel had also one restaurant on the first floor where they served breakfast and in the evenings you could order a la carte. The restaurant was a actually just a large room with a lot of tables and chairs in it. It had no theme and had no decorations. We actually never saw anyone eating there in the evenings. We used to order room service instead and eat on the balcony. The food was actually really good, Thanks to the cook. The breakfast was quite standard with omelets, bacon etc. but not anything special and they used to run out of bacon.    The hotel was close to the beach. The beach was good but you cant really go swimming without being afraid of being hit by a banana boat or jetski. If you have kids then you might want to walk about 500 meters towards Pattaya to the midle of Jomtien beach where there is an enclosure for swimmers.    The area around the hotel has no restaurants or shops except an 7eleven. It is very quiet during the evenings and nights except for the constants barking of dogs wich echoes all the way in to the hotel rooms. The noise of the airconditioning faded some of the barking and the whining of the wind. When we booked the hotel we were told in the email that airport transfer is included in the price. When we cheched out they told us that is not included. PK71 wrote a review Jan 2009\n",
      "40 Nice Hotel We stay in this Hotel due to the tour package.  Hotel is nice & clean, but still under construction in some area. You may hear lots of noise during the date time. The location is little bit away from the tourist area.  Over all My stay was pleasant. Amy H wrote a review Jan 2009\n",
      "30 Not a bad place This hotel is very nice. The view from the balcony over the water is absolutely wonderful. The rooms themselves where large and clean. The bathroom had a huge window overlooking the bed room with a privacy curtain. The restaurant in the hotel did not have very good food. Overall the was not a bad place to stay. It was just far from all the bar's. The beach that was across the street was nice. If your looking to go to the clubs and stuff then i don't recommend this hotel.

      "30 Beautiful Entrance I booked at Nusa Playa on Jomtein Beach as I have 2 teenagers and and 8 year old, so we didn't want to be near the Go-Go Girls etc. Nusa Playa is a good choice for Jomtein, however there is construction going on all around the hotel. The rooms were very nice with a lovely plasma screen television. The pool was the best though, beautiful view of the ocean from the pool.  There is nothing to do at night though at Jomtein, so if you do not fancy staying at the hotel at night, you should consider booking in the city somewhere. The beach is terrible, you cannot swim as it is very dirty, you would have to take a speedboat to a nearby island if you want to swim. Ferhana wrote a review Aug 2008\n",
      "40 Is still developing. This high rise contemporary hotel should be rated 4 1/2 star, but it is still being developed, so I would rate it at present 4. The towers and beach access section are under construction, there is only one restaurant, and the elevators are too few to handle the guests at checkout. The buffets are really well done with a change of theme each night and the a la carte menu has a good selection for Americans as well as others. The infinity pool on the 3rd floor overlooks the water and the SPA has lovely music drifting over it...this was a real plus. The rooms were well appointed and spotless. The service was gracious. The beach is across the street and there are shops all along the street...one fun bar about 6 blocks away, but the cocktails are awful...drink beer! This hotel is about 3 miles south of the main business area of Pattaya. wrldwide wrote a review Jun 2008\n"

      "50 Nice and clean Stayed here beginning of October. Really nice and clean big room I stayed on 3rd floor had a balcony but few wasn’t the best. But who needs a view when the beach is literally a hop, skip and jump until your feet hit the sand. Receptionist was friendly and beer prices good. I would stay here again Mikey J wrote a review Oct 2018\n",
      "50 Food only at the restaurant Did not stay here but eaten there a few times. Food was really good with great service well recommended. Pizza really good and a cracking Penang chicken. Reasonably priced and staff can speak some English. Well worth a visit even if it is very quiet in August Vicsterpt wrote a review Aug 2016\n",

Friendly staff and good location with little restaurants nearby (check out Nok and Sabai Sabai local restaurants nearby). Will be back if we were to do these water sports again. 7/11, mini marts, coffee shops and laundry available nearby. SapphiraNB wrote a review Feb 2020\n",
      "20 not bad but not worth the price I booked one night with a friend, room pool view was spacious, but old. my room had noisy AC and too soft bed. pool view was ok but u cannot enjoy because if u opened the curtain to see pool, the whole pool people would see your entire room, not lovely for privacy. car park was big enough. check-in reception was pretty not welcome feeling, staffs were average. a la carte breakfast was something u dont need it. i felt it was not worth the price i paid for the night. there are better cheaper hotel nearby for this price.  P.S. my friend is a pro photographer, in case the picture is too attractive :P MollyMonchaya wrote a review Feb 2019\n",
      "30 THE HOTEL WITH A SMELL This was probably a very nice hotel in the past, but looks like its going to seed now .It is now sandwiched between two massive building projects. to cram even more tourist into the area. there seems to be a pong of sewer when you sit on the restaurant balcony. Not overpowering but its there . the rooms are large and good value for money .Breakfast included not bad but cold fried eggs spoil it . mikkey wrote a review Feb 2019\n",
      "10 Not the best Good size rooms and location next to the beach, although we didn't visit. Appalling cleanliness standards let it down though and it is not in a specific area, it is everywhere! from the stains on the bed-sheet, to the filthy walls all the way to the back/grey painted walls that try to disguise it. Breakfast was of a very low quality as well Khun-Mor wrote a review Nov 2018\n",
      "40 Lovely small hotel/resort The small resort, is really a nice little place. We stayed in the 3 storey building rooms, as we only stopped for 1 night, so didn't want to pay more for the pool side bungalows, which are actually nicer. Anyhow, the rooms were quite good, clean and well kept. Seems the hotel is quite new. Bed was good and everything was fine. The hotel is right next to the beach, but there is like a lake/river that separates the hotel from the beach area and no proper beach access, seems the bridge they had before got broken and they didnt fix it, you can however access the beach along the side by climbing the ladder and walking along the side of the wall of an old restaurant. It would have been better if there would be a bridge crossing the river to the beach. The beach is quite fine for swimming, no rocks and not much people over there. The pool at the hotel is quite tiny, but nice anyway to take a dip. The breakfast was just Ok, quite simple, and not much choice, egg, ham, sausages, some vegies, watermelon, toast and some thai food, not too great, but OK, best thing was the lovely view as breakfast area has nice sea view. Overall I would recommend this hotel for a short stay, don't think I would stop for more than 1 night in this hotel. Olga S wrote a review Jul 2018\n",
      "50 Fantastic family resort, right on the beach. The location is excellent, right at the beach of Na Jomtien. The resort is set back so you have the spacious rooms, each with their own balcony , a lovely tropical garden and a small relaxing pool, with a lot of sun-beds and easy to walk to the beach . Unlike Jomtien and Pattaya beaches, there is no beach road, which makes it very peaceful and secluded.  Breakfast buffet was excellent and also the evening restaurant was nice, The staff spoke very good English and were very helpful. I will come back for my next vacation. peterdc1990 wrote a review Jun 2017\n",

      "40 English speaking mgr + menu so you can try Russian food... I just ate at the Fat Cat dumpling cafe b/c I wanted to try Russian food but other places did not have a menu in English nor a manager who could speak it. There's a nice lady here who speaks good English and she suggested one raditional soup (Borscht w/ Sour Cream) and the chicken dumplings (when my dad saw the pic, he said his mom or grandmother made the same thing - so they must be an Eastern European wide thing) which are a little different from what the Chinese do as these I think are done in butter and come with sour cream or other dipping options.    I am not an expert on what Russian food is supposed to taste like but I'd definitely try it again for something different and this place is a good one to go to as again, there is an English menu + English speaking manager.

      "50 V.F.M Anyone who complains about this hotel is just a professional moaner. There's a saying you get what you pay for and with this hotel you get far more . The staff are wonderful and helpful and the rooms are more than adequate. Two pools ,air conditioning, room service with continuous power , fresh towels all for just eight pounds a night and for a couple of pounds extra you get a superior room which is far superior to a premier inn . So if you're holidaying on a budget you can't beat this place . Mrs S wrote a review May 2015\n",
      "40 very nice Deluxe room is very nice - A/C, batchroom clean, no toileters (u can ask for them if u need), two clean towels, big bed, TV with english channels. Free water, free pool when u get deluxe room. & eleven and bakery nearby. Short way to the beach - max 5 minutes. For me was great sitondeck wrote a review Apr 2015\n",
      "30 New buildings ok now but not after 2 years Totallythere are 4 buildings and 2 of the new ones. They are nice now but I think after 2 years not so much as I have seen the older ones. That mostly because materials are not the best one and can easily seen how time has effect for them. Also cleaning is not so effective because they don't have any check list what should clean and when.    Staff is nice but not so familiar how to do business like hotel business. And same with owner. Mostly hotel is targeted for Russian tourists but because of economical situation they are less than 50% tourists in Pattaya.    2 small swimming pools are nice as well as location in the end of soi Villa Navin although hotel is located next to the big road (second road in Jomtien, 6 line street) and traffic can be disturb in road side rooms (rooms with balcony) but there are not so much traffic at nights.    One funny thing there are fridge, micro wave own and water heater in shared with 2 rooms outside rooms.    Safety boxes are in the rooms but not fasten to wall in new buildings and wifi was not working there in February 2015 (new buildings) but it was under work. Torstix wrote a review Apr 2015\n",

As always quite hard mattress, but after some investigation and talking to the cleaner, a top matress was found that saved my good night sleep. Opposite the hotel an Swedish/Scandinavian restaurant. Mnilson22 wrote a review Feb 2017\n",
      "30 Basic hotel but good value This is a basic but clean hotel and good value for money. Rooms are big and there is a balcony. Location is good as it's just a few minutes walk to the beach. There are a few good restaurants and bars close by. It also has an elevator and a small pool. The staff are very friendly and helpful.    The only negatives are beds are hard and there is a noisy karaoke down the street which goes on late at night and depending on the room you have can keep you awake.  All in all would recommend it if you are on a budget. orac53 wrote a review Feb 2016\n",
      "20 Basic The rooms are quite spacious, but that's about all they are. There is a little kitchenette and big fridge, and there is also a balcony. So much for the good points. There was near to no water pressure, the bed was rock hard and the rooms very noise - especially when the Thai karaoke is at its best nearby. Sheets and towels not exactly clean. The rooftop pool did not look appealing at all.  Jomtien beach is dirty and quite frankly not worth visiting. It's a 10 minute drive from Pattaya.  The only real plus was the very good restaurant just across the street from this hotel. Stefaan C wrote a review Nov 2015\n"

      "10 Just another poor hotel Had booked rooms by pool, and paid for that. On checkin they tried to give us other rooms, not with pool access.  Had problems with door locks, so we left door to pool open during the visit.  Did not use the pool, as it was more like a green soup than water in it.  Whole place was in dire need of maintenance. Ernst K wrote a review Feb 2020\n",
      "10 Quit and incapable We stayed in this hotel for 3 days. Don't count on a warm welcome, but we got the key faster. Airco works good, bed is ok are the only positive points of this hotel. Lack of hygiene, malfunction warm water and door lock. Room was dirty en swimmingpool for your own risk. Hotel is not in a safe place with many wild dogs. No recommendation to stay.

      "20 be warned not good only stayed 2 nights,  😊ok points, good size room, a little dated but ok, shower very good, curtains black out room very good, bed big and comfortable, nice soft pillows. room service good,, car parking ok.  😒negative points:- we called hotel before booking asked \"swimming pool ok\" we were told yes! also that \" hotel out the way and could be dangerous at night walking\"  we saw no food being served so can't comment on that. so as have car booked it, on arrival pool disgusting as green as you can get, told man coming, hahaha,, we didn't find friendly at all, the hotel itself way out of the main area, and they were right in saying, you would not want to walk back there at night. not easy if you have no transport. feels like the poor end of the beach, would we stay again ? no is the answer, there's lots better around tonyg wrote a review May 2019\n",
      "40 Clean, quiet, large room - decent people I stayed once for four nights then another visit for two nights. It’s clean, quiet very large rooms, en-suite shower room is fine. Fridge, air con all good. 950m walk from the beach and there is swimming pool. Abchi19 wrote a review Mar 2019\n",
      "30 Our stay was ok with some pluses and minuses There were things which we liked as well as things which surprised us in a negative way.  First of all, we booked our room two months in advance - double bed with an extra bed. Our trip itself to get there was very long (two 6 hour flights + transfers and waiting in between flights totalled to 24 hours of travelling), so we wanted to shower and get some rest right when we got to our room and it was already around 11 pm. But when we got upstairs, we were surprised to see only a double bed there. After a while an employee came to our room and started to bring in the extra bed, sheets, pillow and a towel. He came in and out for some 20 minutes and finally the extra bed was set up. That was not cool, but we did not complain, because we were surprised with an upgrade to a family room. The room itself was spacious, neatly decoraded, a bit outdated though. The beds are extremely hard and it takes a few nights to get used to it. The bathroom was also spacious, but I have a hew comments about the bathroom. The shower stream is very poor, it took a looong time to rinse shampoo out of my hair. Also, the water from shower flooded all of the bathroom and the glass wall in the shower did not do anything, because the water can easily flow under it. Room cleaning was okay, clean towels and water bottles were provided daily.  About the staff - we complained one time about the shower flooding the bathroom, they said that someone is going to repair it, but nothing was done. The communication itself was quite difficult, because the staff did not understand what I was saying or pretended not to. It was difficult at times.  About breakfast - first two mornings we were surprised to see a buffet with a selection of hot food and fruit. The rest of the stay had to choose one of the four breakfast options which were brought in portions. Also, no fruit was available then.  Another surprise - the first few nights we could not sleep, because there were chickens and roosters making noise outside right under our window. We were staying on the 6th floor and it was still possible to hear them very loudly. However, after a while we got used to it and slept just fine.  About the pool - it is nice, but too deep for my liking. It is at least 1.80 metres deep. The sunbeds around the pool are nice and beach/pool towels are provided by the hotel which is also very convenient. However, we could sunbathe near the pool only for 3 hours, because then the sun disappeared behind other tall buildings.  Overall it is an ok budget variant hotel if you can get a good deal on it. It is located a 10 minute walk from the beach and the main road. The Jomtien night market is quite far (about 3 kilometres, but it seems too far to walk if it is that hot outside, haha), you definitely need to take some kind of transport to get there. I would stay there again if I got a good deal. However, I would prefer to stay closer to the beach and the main road. Anete T wrote a review Mar 2017\n",
      "30 Mixed review Plus side    The hotel and pool was good value for money it's in a quiet area great to get away from the madness of the main beach road pool area is good and quiet the rooms are cleaned daily to a good standard    Negative side    Lack of English speaking staff  Cruel to the local cat and dogs we witnessed them hitting the cat and throwing there flip flops at the dogs if you were a animal lover this is defiantly not the place for you to stay their are stray dogs all around the area robeverett34 wrote a review Apr 2016\n"

So we had to move in a third room. We were lucky that this day a third room was available. All the room have no cuboards, the wifi is very weak, the breakfast is not lush and the rooms are cleaned dayly only after 3pm. The staff is partially friendly but helpless.

      "40 Great location and rooftop pool We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. Our booking was for 3 people, they had 2 beds, one queen and a single, which was fine but on the single bed there were no linens. We asked for sheet, blanket, pillow, and towel for our 3 person and it was such a hassle...didn't get the blanket until the next day. These bed fel more like sofa beds then a real mattress. It was rock solid.    We had the same incident happen to us, when the male staff member just entered our room without knocking! Very strange. He didn't even say what he wanted or needed. Walked in and saw we were there and left...    The power went off for a while, then when it came back, the internet stopped working for the duration of our stay. Which in the end was good for us in order to fully disconnect and relax!    The breakfast isn't all that interesting. Not worth the 200 bath.    Overall, great location, staff is ok, pool is AMAZING! I stayed a whole day on the rooftop with my umbrella! Cynthia L wrote a review Sep 2018\n"

      "10 Unprofessional staff and beware of the male receptionist Firstly, the most critical part. When I was in my room, just before I am about to wake up, the male receptionist just open my room door without any knocking of the door. And when he realized it, immediately say sorry. He told me he was looking for the hair dryer. So unprofessional!!! He didn't have the basic courtesy to knock the door first. And access the room without any hesitation.  Just imagine if I am not the only one in the room. What if my wife is in the room alone or your girlfriend is alone in the room.    This is totally unprofessional. I have taken the picture of the male staff.    I stayed there for a night. For a stopover in Pattaya. Booked a night with Nida Hotel.  Let me share exactly what happened.  I reached the hotel at 12 noon, and the lady receptionist told me that the check in time was at 2pm. Fair enough, I was early. I was ask to fill in my check in details first that will make my check in later seamless. But when I went back at 1.45pm the room was not ready yet. I only managed to check in at 3pm. No apologies was given. Nothing. They seem that I was waiting for an hour plus was an given to them.    told me breakfast will be ready 6.30am. At 6.45am, breakfast was not ready at all. Not 50% of the items are ready. Not even the cultery are ready to use it to take the ready food. James T wrote a review Aug 2018\n",

      "50 Fantastic pool ! If you are in need of some 'downtime' to relax and work on a tan, tipping you can't do better than Eleven@Jomtien, especially for the price. Correct distance from the beach road to be nice and and quiet, but still an easy 3 min walk to beach and restaurants / supermarket / etc.  Arrived at another hotel (already booked) - but right on the beach road is noisy most of the night and starts again at dawn. Worked out that being beachside = seabreeze, but also = dirty water, especially with onshore wind. So a pool is needed - ocean swimming, ah, 'marginal'. At their pool is GREAT.  In a nutshell:  Friendly helpful staff, clean new(ish) rooms and facilities, breakfast basic - but with Thai options that change daily (enough to be interesting), new modern mountain bikes available to rent.  Firm mattresses - as per most Thai motels.  Wouldn't stay anywhere else in Jomtien. cliffpopp wrote a review May 2018\n",
      "50 Hotel Nida / Eleven Jomtien Great stay. Great price. Friendly receptionist, Khun Poom! One block from beach and easy to get to Walking Street as constant flow of the hop on hop off open taxis at every few minutes. Jomtien night market is next door also. Definitely I come back. Area is quiet so no night noise but close to all the action. Rooms huge and nice. Gustave M. wrote a review Apr 2018\n",
      "50 Best value beach view If you are seeking more privacy Jomtien beach is in a quiet area great to get away  Location was close to the beach just walking distance and it has swimming pool on rooftop!! and the price is in budget 1000 bath Thoroughly recommended malila m wrote a review Apr 2018\n",
      "40 Simple but nice Been here after stayed in another branch of this hotel in Bkk.  Like the privacy and quietness but only few step to the beach and 10 min walk to Jomtien night market.  Big room comfy bed, there’re 2 beds in the room also.  Staffs friendly and helpful.  Buffet breakfast taste ok but menu not super excite.  Love the little pool overlooking the sea and sunset on the evening.  Will definitely come back and recommend friends to visit for sure. MissuSa L wrote a review Apr 2018\n",
      "10 Extremely horrible service! Extremely horrible service!  1. I booked a hotel more than a month and half. But no room available when I got there because the hotel sold the room before I arrive.  2. I emailed them early in the morning at 6:47 am but no reply no call and they have my phone number but upon arrival I knew they got my message.  3. Lair! Upon arrival the staff on duty lies that after they got my message they have called me at 6am but can't contact because my phone turned off. I never turned my phone off and no miss call.  4.The walk-in price is cheaper than book with agents.  5. I booked through the agent website. When a staff told me that no booking and he tried to prove me wrong that I really have no booking. And kept me waiting in the middle of the night. And again he lies to me that he was trying to find me a room. So I walked to the counter again, and clearly see he is looking for the documents to prove wrong that I really have no booking or it had been cancelled.  6. Poor skill of problem solving. Since he knew that no room available he should find me the room in another hotel but I have to advised him.  7. No responsibility and ripoff the price! The room found so he asked me to pay the amount of booking. But the another hotel is a lot cheaper than my booking and no pool for adults. Since it is clearly the hotel mistake, the hotel should show some responsible.  8. I told the night's staff I would like to talk with a megnager in the morning and discuss the problem, no reply nothing, because I wanted to know if I can use the pool overthere and that's all, because I'm OK with the new another hotel but not the pool. Since it is no contact or anything this the result.  9. In the morning I received the cancellation with full amount charge. This is how they treat customer.  10. I aware about the late check in that they may sell my room I did sent emails and called to the hotel at lunch on the arrival date. The staff informed me that she noted.

      "20 Poor service Stayed one night at this hotel in Jomtien.    We arrived early (11:45 am) so wasn't to bothered that we couldn't check in yet. but the attitude was seriously poor (unfriendly and unwelcoming) and we were told that the cleaning staff would be having lunch at 12 so to not come back until 2... The room was clean but very basic. The breakfast was terrible with only a few prepared dishes which were cold and tasteless. This is definitely not a 4 star hotel, maybe 2 star.    The only good thing is the location which is a two minute walk to the beach and there are many nearby restaurants. ThailandTravel2016 wrote a review Mar 2018\n",
      "20 OK This hotel in Jomtien is ok but staff let it down.    Rooms are big but keep in mind superior rooms don't have seaviews. Only deluxe do.    Breakfast is a disaster. Limited selection which is understandable as price for rooms is cheap but eggs are cold. Basically inedible.    Staff are amongst the rudest i have cone across in Thailand. From front desk to restaurant service staff there was never any acknowledgement of guests.    Lift your game Eleven. Ecpkoko wrote a review Feb 2018\n"

      "20 Terrible service at reception I booked here 2 nights for my parents and her friends. The room was okay but I requested via phone before arriving to take out the extra bed from the room they said okay but on arrival it was still inside. As second I have to complain that they charged my card up front without telling me. I wanted to pay by cash instead of card.  When leaving I asked for a taxi from the hotel in jomtien to the theprasit airport bus station. The receptionist wanted to charge ridiculous 800 baht for the 2.5 km transfer, so I had to go outside the hotel and look for a taxi by my own.  Hotel = okay  Receptionist service = terrible Timo wrote a review Nov 2017\n",
      "40 Great bargain right in the middle of Jomtien Nice small boutique looking hotel. Just 100 meters to the beach and right in the middle of Jomtien. Sits back a side street,so it's a quite location off the main drag.    Room was clean and modern, cold A/C, and good wifi. For the price, it couldn't be beat and it included breakfast, which isn't anything special, but sufficient. Per night rate was literally cheaper than the cost of breakfast at my American brand 4 star hotel in Bangkok. My local Thai friends were skeptical when they saw the booking price, but were quite impressed when they dropped me off. El_Coyote3 wrote a review Sep 2017\n",
      "10 Bad service We stayed 7 nights here. We payed the room when we came but after 5 days they said that there has been some sort of miscalculation and they asked us to pay 850 BAHT more. We didn't do that. After this the service got bad. The recepcionist who made the mistake was very harsh and irrespective to us. Furthermore there was no warm water in shower and for a while there was a horrible smell of cigarrette in the bathroom. Sanni Kataja-aho wrote a review Mar 2017\n",
      "20 Lost our booking When we arrived nobody was aware of our booking, despite our calling to confirm our stay since we were arriving pretty late (about 11pm). While it became clear pretty quickly that no room was available for us, staff wasted about 25 minutes trying to fault us for the missing booking instead of owning up to their mistake.    They did arrange a room in a nearby cheap guesthouse for us, but gave us the prospect of potentially being able to move in the next day. However when we woke up the next morning our booking had been cancelled and they still tried to collect the cancellation fee, which due to the late cancellation would have been the full booking amount. So we had to waste some more time with Booking.com's customer support to make sure there won't be an actual charge. Needless to say the explanation the hotel offered to Booking.com was very different from what they told us, namely that a member of staff had given away our room.    Now mistakes do happen, especially during a busy period of the year. But when they do you should take full responsibility for them and not try to blame them on your customers.

      "30 Fire Safety Concerns, Sparsely furnished, Spacious bed. Stayed 27-Dec-2014 for 1-night in Superior-room 303  Key-card and lift-electronic-display stated hotel as 'TONNAM' (probably former name).    Has 1-lift and very-small safe-in-room.    My-Fire-safety-concerns:  No door-spy-hole.  No fire safety instruction on room door.  No fire escape/exits signage in corridor.  No smoke detectors in room.    Bad-points: Telephone on table by main-door (not near bed), coffee cups only (no sachets of tea/coffee)!, only 1 large towel each (no hand towels),  no bedside tables/cabinets, no bin in room (weird!), front-door-stop in middle of path (so constantly stubbing toes on it), no pictures on walls & minimum furniture (looked bare).    Good-points: Double & single bed pushed together (very spacious),  good shower cubicle, nice large balcony with chairs & table.    Observations:  No breakfast instructions when checking in.  Went to breakfast at 09:30, however there was hardly anything left.    Went to rooftop pool at 10:50am, there were empty beer-glasses on a number of tables (from previous day). Pool was nice though, great views.    Road (soi-11) outside, leading to main road, under construction so taxi unable to stop at reception. Had to carry luggage up soi (2-mins), no assistance with luggage in hotel.    No restaurants nearby, need to take tuk-tuk taxi to restaurants/night market.    Beach close by, not crowded, mainly Russian tourists and Thai families.    Would stay in Jomtien Beach Soi4/Soi6 next time - restaurants. Ranjit-Muay wrote a review Dec 2015\n",
      "40 A delightful small hotel, just off the beach This is a near new, clean, comfortable small hotel, on a quiet side road, few minutes to the beach. Good breakfast and wifi and a small pool on the roof, with a view. Our room was spotless, with a balcony and a glimpse of the sunset. A night table and a reading lamp would make it perfect. wanderlust1944 wrote a review Nov 2015\n",
      "40 New hotel in quiet Soi Hotel is a rather new and it is situated Soi11 in Jomtien. Hotel is the biggest building in this soi, otherwise there are smaller nice houses rented mostly for local people.The soi is quiet in weekdays but during weekend there are lot of parties in houses.    The hotel main target looks like to be Asian travelers.    As mentioned the hotel is new and rooms are spacious and large beds. Thera are balconies too and in the bathrooms either shower or shower and bathtub depends on room class.    There are also marvelous swimming pool with service at the roof with a view. You can swim and see the sea in the same time.    Service and staff is good in the hotel. Only minuses were that when emailed an inquiry no reply at all. And walk in price was higher as when asked in high season and price always included breakfast, no change to have room only price. That makes me wonder. As well as when I went to look rooms and decided to stay I did not same kind of room with bigger balcony as showed.    Breakfast was mostly for Asian visitors not so much for western and that makes room price a little bit too high.    After all this hotel is a good choice staying in Jomtien beach Torstix wrote a review Apr 2015\n"

      "50 Nice rooms good service I enjoy Honey house 3 because the rooms are clean and comfortable and bright. The service is great, staff friendly and helpful. I have felt safe here and never have had  any thefts. Good prices also help. stargeezer2014 wrote a review Feb 2020\n",
      "50 Good relaxing visit A good relaxing staying with no issue. Nice and clean room. Breakfast in the morning if you can wake up before 10am. All essentials, fridge, safe, flat television, wardrobe, soap and shampoo. Worth the money. Daniel B wrote a review Dec 2018\n",
      "50 Excellent stay Lovely clean, comfortable and quiet hotel within a short walking distance to Jomtien beach. Restaurant on site and many bars, restaurants coffee shops close by. Breakfast was an optional extra but was inexpensive. Room was excellent too StevenG1966 wrote a review Apr 2018\n",
      "50 A Great Stay at The Honey House I arrived at the hotel and got a great reception from the staff.  They done a great breakfast and served food during the day  They also sold Beers, soft drinks tea and coffee all day.  This hotel is only a couple of years old so was nice and fresh.  Great room very big. The cost was very low well worth the money.  Lot of British people stopped there for a chat and a beer in the  afternoon.  It is very close to the beach and there are lots of bars and restaurants  close by.  Also close to shops and amenities.  I would stay there again. Michael H wrote a review Nov 2017\n",
      "30 Awful night time reception staff Stayed here for 4 days febuary 17 to the 21 good room pleasant daytime staff but the receptionist at night was a witch we were two couples but my friends girlfriend arrived later in the evening and was belittled and made to feel acutely embarassed will not stay again because of this one woman John J wrote a review Feb 2017\n",
      "40 Reasonable price - reasonable accommodation Only stayed for one night but the accommodation was fine, clean and everything worked. Bed was a bit hard and the shower room a bit tired but the ups were big TV with many English speaking channels, everything was clean and tidy and the beach only a hop, skip and a jump away. Steviee wrote a review Nov 2016\n",
      "50 “Lovely place for the independent traveler looking for an affordable and local, non-resort vacation.” I stayed here on after leaving a condo,and wanted something near my golf buddies.WOWED. The hotel was just renovated, the service was over the top. The assistant manager, and staff were very accommodating . I was only planning to stay for two days, but stayed for 8 days. for 690bht how could i go wrong, Jomtien Beach 100 meters , restaurant across the street,and a 7-eleven.Jomtien Beach area so there's plenty of things to do. 1trugamer wrote a review May 2016\n"

      "10 Shocked! I booked a room at this hotel.  Within 3 minutes I walked out. I came a little early so I expected the room not to be ready. I asked if the hotel was full. The staff response was “no” with a very snotty and cold attitude already. I inquired is if the hotel is not busy, can I pay for an upgrade to a better room that is ready. Again the answer was no. No reason, no explanation, nothing. I honestly do not understand how a hotel would not jump at the opportunity to make MORE money by upgrading a paying guest. Especially during the Covid crisis. At that point I said I am cancelling my booking. She honestly did not care. At all. Extremely rude. I asked if there was a manager on site? No. Can I call the manager? No. I have NEVER been treated so poorly in any situation regarding hospitality  Avoid this place at all costs. Honestly this was the RUDEST experience I have ever  Had. All things considered. I am glad things worked out the way they did. I ended up staying at the Avani resort in Pattaya which to be honest was just gorgeous. Figured it wouldn’t hurt to explain what I had just experienced at the D@Sea and without saying anything at all, I was upgraded to bigger, seaview suite. They waived the 1000 baht deposit and our first drink at the poolside bar was on the house. Now that is service. All done with a big friendly smile.  I have had nothing short of extremely professional, pleasant and friendly experiences at ALL Minor Group Hotels. In and outside of Thailand. Always 1st class.  Thank you for taking a HUGE negative and turning it into a MASSIVE POSITIVE.  ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ sea2dub wrote a review Aug 2020\n",
      "50 EXTREMELY FRIENDLY STAFF As the reviews indicate, the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Thank you very much. The room is like a studio apartment and we fit 2 adults and 2 children comfortably (with 2 single beds). 100 baht extra per child for breakfast. Had no idea we were next to a very popular and busy crab seafood place and just watching 500 cars on a Saturday night go through this restaurant from our balcony was interesting (picture attached). Overall, good hotel to stay in for a night or short term. Haven’t had breakfast yet but sure it will be fine. Thank you for taking care of us here (with the children, umbrellas and parking).

      "10 Not satisfied!! Not worth the money we paid for. The hotel is close to the beach but you can’t really swim here and or no sun lounges to relax.    We booked a junior suit but when we arrived they put us in a one bedroom at the condominium by the street (not where the lobby, restaurant and swimming pool is). The room has a big balcony but no chairs for sitting. No wi-fi available on this front road building. Called the staff for it but he just said, not available!!    Not worth for a junior suit. AndWeWander wrote a review May 2019\n",
      "20 Stay away The staff switch between being nice and unhelpful. The room was very dirty for our 10vist. The hot plate didn’t, the sofa was stained. A fire alarm went off early one morning, no staff attended. I had to go to reception in the building next door to inform them. I travel more than the average person and can say I have never seen eggs cooked and served in such a bad way.  The location is at the end of the beach (rocks) and lond wall or short ride to when life begins.  Would I recommend this hotel-NO. Would I go there again-NO. Value for money, if the breakfast improves and cleanliness improves - MAYBE Chris wrote a review Jan 2019\n",
      "40 Good value Nice clean rooms, good room rate if booked online (can still be done on your phone while you are in the lobby). You have to be of the location, which we were and we were happy with it. It helps if you have your own car. Rooms were clean, beds comfortable, all in good condition. Have not tried their breakfast so cannot judge it. One of the most famous seafood restaurants in Jomtien is right next door. Fiftycountriesplus wrote a review Aug 2018\n",
      "50 It’s worth to pay. The hotel is at the end of Jomtien beach and it is so private. The hotel is near to “Poo Pen”, it is famous seafood  restaurant. The swimming pool is so good. You can enjoy the view there. Here is fitness as well. Room is so clean. You can walk 3 mins to the beach and family mart is near as well. There is “roti” (Thai sweet) in front of the road opposite famous seafood restaurant name  “Poo Pen”. We will come back and visit here again for sure. Tuang P wrote a review Jun 2018\n",
      "40 Worth a Hit It is a beach side hotel with really good rooms. The area is bit off the city but a cozy one. One minute walking distance from the sea and a wonderful restaurant near it is Pupen that serves awesome sea food. As such Thailand as a whole is a sea food heaven. H R Sharma wrote a review Feb 2018\n",
      "40 Stayed at their other building Friendly staff, they accomodated all of our requests! Although the condo we stayed at triggered my allergy because of dirt (we stayed at the penthouse), we asked them to clean it again and my allergy went away. Awesome service. Food is good also :-)  GREAT view! Ming Moore wrote a review Sep 2017\n",
      "50 The bast on beach / D @ Sea Experience peaceful serenity amidst the beautiful bustling energy of Jomtien Beach.    D@SEA Hotel is ideally located at the end of Jomtien Beach Road, within a 2 minute walk to the beach.    D@SEA offers One Bedroom and Studio options. Each room is enhanced with modern decor and premier amenities to provide outstanding quality service coated with exceptional Thai hospitality. Enjoy your days at the delightful D@SEA Hotel.    All rooms are modern design, full facilities including wi-fi access. Other amenities include a full range of restaurants, a bar and swimming pool. Kanjananatch P wrote a review Apr 2017\n",
      "30 Place to relax (not for Nightlife) D@SEA Hotel is located at the end of Jomtien Beach Road and it’s very close to the beach, just 5 minute walk to the beach. But the beach was a poor beach, so you cannot swim, or do any activity on this beach.    The hotel room was large, modern, clean and quiet. The amenities and facilities in room were good, including free wi-fi access. Unfortunately that I got the room is not seaview.    The staff was friendly and helpful. The Breakfast was so so. There were no nightclub, bars or café nearby the hotel. If you don't have your own vehicle, it is difficult if you would like to go out. The hotel is far from main road and it has only Thai seafood restaurant near by the hotel. apimukp wrote a review Jan 2017\n"

      "20 A Place to avoid We booked online and saw a rack rate of 6,000bht and an available price of 1,600bht including breakfast. Sounds ok but ... I will try to be fair    Pros: Staff are pleasant and friendly and try to help,  Ok only: Breakfast, rooms in general (dull but ok), rooftop pool (so so hot and no shade)  Cons: beach is poor at this part of Jomtien, no nightlife (dead), open sewers in front of hotel provides a foul stench all day, very poor construction means things don't work, toilet blocked when we were there, NOISE (paper thin walls and hollow core doors without closers means you hear every footstep from outside all night long, slamming doors will wake you, and staff of walkie-talkies at 7am will wake you if the doors and the lift bell does not (dont come here for sleep) safe is tiny and is not secured (so can be stolen) single lift means you wait when the bus tours arrive, giant pillows are impossible to use (we rolled up the bathrobes.    The places is a joke, stay away. AdrianVp58 wrote a review May 2015\n",
      "40 Weekend We had a room here and was really supprised by the fresh rooms. We had seaview from balcony and just one stair up to the pool on the rooftop which was very nice.  The cleaning was good and beds not to hard as they usually are. In the evening the shower was going from warm to cold a lot so that was not the best but in the morning it was just fine and working properly. To sit in bed and lean against the headboard to check your pc was ok as long as both didn't do it becuase then the wheels on the bed moved against the slick floor.  One bad thing was the safetybox which was the same model as i saw 20 years ago in hotels and really small. It also was not mounted so the safety was same as zero with this one since anybody could carry it out without beeing seen.  Modern ones has space for a 15 inch laptop and should be standard.  There was more good things than bad anyway since the personal was very kind and it is a good clean hotel to stay at. Also the location of the hotel at the end of the street was very good.  I have to say that the overall experience was good and i would definately sleep there again if i'm in Pattaya.  We do recommend this hotel if you are looking for a more quiet and calm place to live at. Koykrati S wrote a review Apr 2015\n"

      "50 Budget, location and service friendly digs. 'Z BY ZING', is an honest place to stay, most particularly for the budget and location conscious, tourist spending time in lovely Jomtien Beach. I really enjoyed the flexible attitude to reasonable service requests, as well as the quiet acoustics and expanded space, in my studio room. It is an easy, flat, five (5) minute walk to the beach, with heaps of; dining, drinking, entertainment, shopping and spa places (see my YouTube), occupying the surrounds. Coffee Chill wrote a review Sep 2020\n",
      "40 3 night stay It was good hotel. Location is little bit behind from beach . But , As compare to price that’s good . The staff of hotel are also good and polite . I would recommend to all those whose are looking for cheap and best stay .    Thanks & Regards  Uppal Narinder wrote a review Jun 2019\n",
      "50 Location, value for money, service! 200 metres from Jomtien Beach, cheap, big room, smiles and service. I needed the internet to be good for some work on holiday. Had a problem (one they had never had before....my problem, not the internet) and the staff went “over the top” to try to help. In the end, changing our room so we could access a different service at the hotel. And it worked perfectly! Thankyou “Zingers”! Charlie B wrote a review Jun 2019\n",

      "10 Pictures LIE !! This hotel is a dive i wouldnt stay here if i got paid i booked this hotel from reading review since my inlaws needed a place to stay for a few days while my wife and i stayed at another hotel close by. They got a room on the roof yes on the roof apparently they had taken down the roof and build extra rooms up there AC could not cool the room the wall was thinner than a pancake and it had a smell of paint that made you feel dizzy. The location is also bad its in an ally with bad lighting just the place where you expect to get robbed or worse. When we confronted the receptionist she said this kind of hotel is not one you book in advance or even for a longer period its from ppl walking in from the street wanting to stay one night ( Like the sort of place you would take a prostiture i imagine maybe thats why it get good reviews ? ) anyway we got our money back and found another hotel.

      "40 Soilt by tepid shower The 2nd of our stopovers on our 3 month trip to SE Asia. Well situated about halfway along the beach Road Jomtien. Two minute walk from hotel to beach itself. Staff helpful and pleasnt enough. Free coffee tea etc at reception. Room spotless, modern and well equipped, again with beverage making facilities.  Big positive: wifi excellent and continuous; price less than 600 baht per night  Big negative: shower tepid. Had to use kettle to shave. No room view.  Lift available  Recommended👍👍 Sco666 wrote a review Oct 2018\n",

I got my refund by Expedia as they understood my issues...and still debating for cash reservation was done for a previous night...really horrible experience...also I added pictures of insects with cocoons on the walls that are not cleaned...the worse is the mold...had to open the sliding door that made the room full of mosquitoes... abasilioss wrote a review Apr 2018\n",

Just opposite to this hotel you can rent 2 wheeler which was good....beach is also nearby.... ritika z wrote a review Apr 2018\n",
      "40 Great value for Money, Nice clean Hotel I have stayed here on a number of occasions. The rooms are reasonably priced, basic but very clean and comfortable. The staff are friendly and it is about a 5 minute walk down to the beach. It is quite far south in Jomtien, however, you can get the Songthaew / Baht bus for 10 baht anywhere in Jomtien. Plenty of dining options nearby and also down on the seafront.    On my last visit I did have a number of problems with the Wifi. On previous visits, the wifi worked well but on quite a few occasions I could not get online. I would suggest they try to fix this. Travellerfreddy wrote a review Feb 2018\n",
      "40 Very good value for your money I booked two rooms in this hotel through booking.com after reading the reviews in tripadvisor.com and I was not disappointed. The place is modern, clean and convenient for the beach and -most of all- very cheap. After a week there, we decided to stay 10 days more. The rooms are big, the wifi excellent, the aircon. the tv, the bathroom, the safe, the fridge, everything was perfect. the only draw back is that it is at the end of Jomtien soi 12 and you need to walk 5' to reach the main road or the beach. There is no breakfast or coffee shop, but they have a coffee machine at the lobby working free every morning: basic but very good place. Although the rooms are all non-smoking (which is good), they have a couple of tables at the porch where you can have a cup of coffee smoking a fag. Simple, basic, clean, convenient and very cheap: we paid an average of $15 per room per day. Recommended. phayaoThailand wrote a review Nov 2017\n"

      "50 OUTSTANDING We stayed here for 4 days, first night my bed wasn't to comfortable so I spoke to reception and within 10 minute they put a mattress topper on. This made the bed outstanding. The hotel is super clean, the cleaners are very friendly. The pools are clean, top deck pool is pretty over looking the city. One thing I didn't like is the Indians were all swimming in there pants, and this does really annoy me cause it's just the dirtiest of things. Maybe staff could tell me shorts need to be worn. Apart from that could not fault a single thing we loved our stay, and this place is worth more then what they charge, we paid 2,700 for 4 days. Very very cheap but great place. jaslilydunn wrote a review Aug 2017\n",
      "30 Nothing exceptional.... Did arrived there around 3pm there, room was ready.  Check in went quite ok without real greetings as well any welcome amenities as a simple glass of juice or fresh water. No information provided about the room and property.  Room 401 is quite ok, big enough for 2 persons but not really well cleaned. Food or brownish stains on white walls in the room as well plenty of toothpaste spots around the sink in the bathroom, sliding room is a kind of mouldy/rusty and doesn't give a good impression about hygiene. Good water pressure as well hot water was ok enough. Limited foreigner TV channels, small fried, safety deposit box locked, asked to open it but never happened...  Plenty of plugs around the room, wifi was ok and not always stable....  In conclusion nothing extraordinary or to make it wow.  Pictures are better than the reality...  Few long Asian lady hair on the floor closed to the bed too who is a big turn off for me without being picky.... Chris V wrote a review Jul 2017\n",
      "30 Close to the beach The staff working there are not very nice or friendly. But the hotel is 5 minutes from the beach and restaurants. The rooms are pretty clean but the toilet was a problem. The shower pressure was very strong and the toilet seat was a yellowish stain like colour. We were out all day and basically stayed the night so wasn't as bad. The place is ok to stay the night.

      "40 Clean Room Budget Friendly If you're looking for a clean yet budget friendly hotel Z by Zing is the place for you. Not fancy but clean and the staff wonderful. The location is 1 Block from the beach and the Baht Bus that can take you to Jontiem Beach or into town for less than a cup of coffee. If you're looking for fancy hotel look elsewhere but I give it a 10 for cleanliness, convenience and quietness. G R wrote a review May 2017\n",
      "20 Rude and arrogant staff The behaviour of staff was rude. A guy named Aon Chanamon behaved as if he was the king and we were his servants. On asking for cups for coffee, he started shouting at us and said that we can bring cups from our rooms if we need any coffee. Don't know how such poor hospitality gets such good reviews on Tripadvisor. Saksham03 wrote a review May 2017\n",
      "50 Valuable price,Rooms not too bad , receptionist worst!!! I'm glad we only stay 4 hours at this budget hotel , due have to go back for work in BKK next day. room was okay for its price per night. 486 baht , small cockroaches we found but it's okay since we just stay for hours. but receptionist i can't miss to mentioned here. we kindly ask reception if we can have a new towel due the towel in the room we have used is dirty and not in good condition towels it's like a rag though, but 2 Guys and 1 lady receptionist insist that they will not change because we stay only 1 night, but i insist that will just stay for 4 hours besides the towel they provide is like a rag , so the woman (receptionist) says that she will going to change just for us in a very bad sarcastic way and bring to the room , but until we check out there's no towels deliver in the room.

      "40 Great budget hotel Room very large and roomy clean and modern, staff friendly and welcoming few minutes walk from beach and restaurants. Approx 20min by car to central  Pattaya through traffic so a bit out of the way if you don't have transport. Would recommend hotel. erske2016 wrote a review Jan 2017\n",
      "50 You get what you pay for. The room is big enough, clean and tidy.    It's located about 500m from Jomtien Beach Road and is very quiet. Nothing close by to cause too much noise.    There is complimentary coffee in reception and tea (40 baht), not sure if you have to pay for the toast. It would be awesome if they could provide filter coffee.    This is a budget hotel and the location bears this out. There doesn't appear to be any rooms with a view. The reception front is opposite a car park. My room has the view of the side of another hotel. Not the type hotel where you can laze around if you didn't want to go sight-seeing. BrianF10 wrote a review Jan 2017\n",
      "50 Best for it's price Staff of Z by Zing is topping the overall package. A clean, well maintained place. At the heart of Jomtien beach but laid back enough to avoid the noise of the beach road traffic. A good stay for a night or a couple of days at this destination.

      "50 Great little budget hotel in Pattaya for couple Young staff, very nice people, great price, super clean room, excellent bed, small to medium size room. I'd say pretty also, but that's taste. Coffee available all the time. Guess it depends on what you like, so people who complain it's not near the crowded downtown glitzy part of Pattaya are right. But me and my lady friend (we're a 50's and 60's age group) just loved it. A five minute or less walk to very nice beach, quiet at the end of deserted street for us was fine. Wonderful inexpensive delicious restaurant right around the corner. Incredibly inexpensive, well run, not fancy, but what do you need for a romantic little vacation besides a beautiful beach with hawkers offering you fresh pineapple and mangoes every few minutes for a pittance, and a quiet safe room. And a great name to remember, Z by Zing, my friend and I laugh about it when we think of it! neilturetsky wrote a review Aug 2016\n",

But very disappointed at the location.It was far from the Pattaya city or walking street. When you need to walk back to your hotel, you need to walk through a short distance which would spent you about 2 mins from the main road. It was near to the under~construction property. The noise is very terrible and make us leave the room as soon as possible. Cheryl C wrote a review Jun 2016\n"

This hotel is on the quieter Jomtien beach area and hence far from all actions.But you can always -any time- walk to the main road and take a shared tempo-songtaew- and reach anywhere in just 10THB per head.    Jomtien beach is just 2 mins walk...so you can take stroll or just sit on the beaches in the night.    Overall, a very good place to stay and well within budget. (but if your are a gang of boys willing to spend to stay closer to walking street...then dont choose jomtien beach area...or this hotel)    No views from your window unless you take the topmost floor. sinhasaurabh014 wrote a review Jun 2016\n",
      "30 The location turned me off! Stay here on my recent visit to pattaya, i found this property on booking.com on 8.0 rating, therefore i thought this would be a good choice, but it turn out to be the opposite for me.    Here's the pros of the hotel:  1. It's cheap, it cost much cheaper than any other hotel in pattaya.  2. It's clean, yes i say its clean. The rooms are well kept, no stains on bedsheets or toilets.  3. The Shower is good. The water rush on these showers are really good!  4. Wifi is super fast! I was happy with it!  5. This place is quite, away from the clubs and bars, at night it can be very deserted.    Here's the cons, as per my review. If you are a party goers, looking for entertainment then it's a big no for you! Here's why i said so:  1. The Location! It's way too far from the central pattaya or walking street! These part of pattaya (jomtien) is a bit laidback, thr's not much entertainment here and everytime you wnt to go to walking street 'sontheaw' ride cost between 150bt to 200bt. So you still lose the money you save on the hotel rate!  2. The surrounding is no good. This part of the town is on construction site, or these buildings are abandoned! So i can get abit frightening at night. But no problems, just that its on deserted place.  3. The rooms has rules, they will charge you not only for damage but also for dirty! Therefore if you stay here, then you got to be very very careful with their stuff.  4. Door has Gaps! Doors when closed has got gaps in between, if there's anyone whom tried to peep, i believe they can see!    I would not come here back, simply because of the location. Rather pay abit more and stay in places near central pattaya. mk_steven_r wrote a review Jun 2016\n",
      "50 Comfortable Stay One of the favourite hotel we stayed in Thailand. Lovely environment. The place is clean and beautiful. Nearby to Jomtien Beach, local restaurants and massage centers. Staffs speak English. It made easy to communicte with them. Worth an experience. Loved it! ArViNKuMaR wrote a review May 2016\n",

      "50 Hotel is kept extremely clean at all times. This place is a little off the beaten path which can be both good and bad. The bad is that you are away from all the 'action' in the Jomtien/Pattaya area which can be good on it's own, and the good part is that if you want a nice quiet place to be that is super reasonable then you have found it. It's about the equivalent of 2-3 blocks from the beach so it's just a short stroll to get there. Or take a passing songtow and head off to the Night Market or Rampoo market for some great street food for next to nothing. While the rooms can seem a little sparse from Western standards and there really isn't any view from the rooms, this isn't where I spent my waking hours. Good place to just come back to and get cleaned up so you can head back out and get some food (and maybe a beer). Ken M wrote a review Apr 2016\n",
      "40 Good place to stay I really like this hotel the rooms are nice and clean. The staff are very friendly and speak good English. The hotel is close to the beach and local restaurants. The price is very good if you are looking for a budget hotel then check this place out. ScubaPattaya wrote a review Mar 2016\n",
      "30 \"Ok\" budget hotel. I was looking for a cheap place to spend one night before moving on from Jomtien Beach... This achieves that goal. The first thing you notice about the room is how big it is. It's massive. BUT with all this space there ia very little you can do with it, one small couch, a bed and a writers table try to soak up the vast space but fail. Its got a \"white\" theme going on with a ton of lights in the ceiling that amplify the rooms whiteness when turned on. Its just not my cup of tea. You wont get that romantic golden glow here. But the price is low, its clean and appears safe. Location is ok. = central Jomtien behind the main street. 1 minute walk to the beach. Deceptive37 wrote a review Mar 2016\n",
      "30 Ok but still not good! Z by Zing is hidden in the end of a blind ally with hostels and industry as neighbours. It's not a nice neighbourhood but it also means you are a distance from the noisy cars in the busy street.  My room was clean but very impersonal. Not a cosy room. The doors had really big openings around it and it was tried fixed with rubber bands but without mentionable success! I could look out into the hallway. Both light and noise came through easily at night.  Staff was polite and helpful. But the shower was fantastic! Loads of water and as hot as you wanted it from the large shower head.  The beach is not very far away but I never went to stay there.  Along the busy street there are lots of sale booths. Everything from fresh fruit, street food, travel agencies and various souvenirs.

      "40 Good budget hotel From the Zing family.  I stayed in 3 hotels of their chain, this one was the one I liked the least, but still good for what you paid.    Welcome at the reception was cold, room was nice and bright.  Some details however could easily be ameliorated though (coffee bags in room were forgotten, coffee cups still dirty).  Location nog far from the bracht but the other Zing-hotel in Pattaya is beter located in my opinion.    All in all very decent for what you pay. Jan_P_1984 wrote a review Mar 2016\n",
      "40 Nice budget hotel near the beach... The hotel is nice and comfortable. Near to jomtien beach but not so near to central Pattaya. It has all the basic amenities like wifi, t.v., fridge etc. Overall, a good stay and can be recommended to other guests who wish to stay at a quieter place. Piyushb88 wrote a review Jan 2016\n",
      "50 Great stay, only minor improvements needed We were really pleasantly surprised when we arrived at this hotel. We booked a superior double room for two weeks over Christmas & new year, and could happily have stayed longer. The location is perfect; right near the beach and still set back from the noise of the main road. 10 baht buses will run you anywhere in the area from this main road. Everything in the room worked and nothing leaked, which was a real difference from the other places we've stayed in Thailand. Inside the room was spotless, but the balcony was constantly grubby. It was quiet at night, but we were woken early most mornings by the building work next door, which we disappointingly hadn't been forewarned about. Building started around 7:30am most mornings and was hard to sleep through in our room, but maybe some rooms are quieter than others. They sell tea, coffee and toast in the foyer, and there is a 30 baht washing machine right outside the hotel if their laundry prices are a little pricey for you (like they were for us). The staff were not that brilliant, but not in any way rude; I think they were maybe just shy as their English was a little limited. Everyone apart from the manager just seemed to ignore us completely, unless we approached them first. Aircon and WiFi worked well. The bed was hard but no worse than the rest of Thailand. I highly recommend this hotel! Abby C wrote a review Jan 2016\n",
      "50 Awesome! The room is clean.. New hotel, so the property is great. It has a refrigerator in the room. Nice staff, i got so many helps of the direction from them..  But the lift only take to 5th floor.. I got the 6th floor, so i have to take a stair.  Over all, it was so great place to take a rest.. icha29 wrote a review Dec 2015\n"

      "20 Basic Basic budget hotel. Rooms are undoubtedly big and everything else is very basic.Can't expect much with such pricing. The hotel however expect a deposit of 1000 bath upon check in.    Room: The room does have a safe but the size is about 6 X 4 inches so it is not very useful. The room doors are still using the conventional type of locking system so it is rather easy to prise open which made me feel rather insecure. There were on going construction work going on outside so by 9am I was totally awake by the natural alarm clock.    Staff: The staff, they are not very well versed in almost everything because whatever I ask I only got a yes, no or I don't know answer.    Location: The hotel location is really hard to find even for the locals so had to use another hotel as a landmark for cabs. The vicinity of the hotel don't really serve much food however if anyone is willing to walk about 500m there are some food stalls outside.    Wifi: the hotel provide encrypted wifi and the stability was ok.    Conclusion: This hotel has nothing to shout about but well for a budget hotel I guess it'll suffice.

      "50 Great budget hotel I am Thai tourist. This is my first time travelling in Pattaya alone. Z by Zing is so great about the price, cleanliness, service-minded staff. I paid around 480 baht per night through Expedia which it really worth staying here. I am so impressed about the super clean new room with the fridge. You can walk to the Jom-tien beach in 5 minutes. You can also find laudromat near there. At first, I planned to stay for a night but I extended to 3 nights. Thank you for good stay ^^ Teer1985 wrote a review Oct 2015\n",

They dont give bike on rent but there is a hostel on the opposite site owned by a european person i guess from where you can rent bike. Quite near to the beach and family mart.

      "50 Two STARS but excellent This brand new Hotel is the third Zing Hotel in Pattaya /Jomtien . This little brother on the beach road from the famous Jomtien Beach near Soi 12 is a brand new Hotel . It is the typical Zing style -the same as Zing PP and Zing in Pattaya . This Hotel has to grow ofcourse but it is very clean - very chaep and 40 meters from the sea. So ideal for backpackers and the people with a small wallet . Big rooms and flatscreens - one of the best in the busgetclass. And nice foreign and thai staff always smiling - Important. Jos R wrote a review Mar 2015\n"

      "20 It doesn't worth your money!!!!! We went there for a night and we did not think it worth the money at all!    We reserved the garden villa which is away from the main lobby, we had to drive to the villa by ourself without information on the website and the parking area is the nightmare, and it's next to the huge & noisy laundry room which staff kept the door open so we notice that they put all the towels on the floor.    The room is outdated, dark, but big enough for us. The bed was very comfortable, clean, great pillows.    And you may need to bring your own bath amenities as they provided only cheapest bath amenities which it has not nice smell as same as the amenities you may find in the hostel.    Again after the long drive from home, you have to drive to the villa and drive to enjoy hotel facility at Alexa Beach Club as it too far to walk.    Alexa Beach Club is the best place in this hotel that you could feel relax, the pool & bar are well organizied and they have a lot of choices for cocktail, beer or wine. Only a bit upset with the food as the quality doesn't match with the over price which was set by the hotel    Breakfast buffet will be served at Alexa Beach Club and had limited choice of food but great.    Lastly we would like to thank you for the service from all staffs, we know that it's the hard time for them at this stage.    Nothing can bring us back ............

When queried were told we would have to pay an extra 1,700 per night for a pool villa, as the agent had only booked a room. As we had paid in advance we were not at all impressed.

If they CLEANED the BEACH and land accross from the Alexia beach and got rid of the loud awful music and played nice music maybe I would recommend this place. TJ Knight wrote a review Feb 2020\n",
      "20 Marred by ridiculously loud drum & bass music Would be 5 stars except for the room was a little tired and needed a repaint however it was clean and the AC worked well.    The room service is good and accommodated a non menu meal I wanted.    The biggest problem is the sheer volume of the music played at Alexa Beach. This alone knocked 3 points off. It goes on until 11pm. The drum and bass literally made my room shake. I paid for a deluxe Sea View room because I thought it would be relaxing. I was here for the weekend to recharge my batteries but if you wish to sleep and relax in the afternoon or evening you can forget it I'm afraid. This Alexa beach club has destroyed what was a very tranquil area. Its trying to be Ibiza and failing. I stayed down here to be away from the noise of Pattaya/Jomtien.  My advice is unless you want to hear drum and bass until 11pm pounding away then this won't be the place for you.    I won't be back to stay here I'm afraid. Gilesheaton wrote a review Dec 2019\n",
      "20 Disgustlingly Loud Music on Beach, All Day Here's the bottom line: if you're coming for a quiet, relaxing getaway close to Bangkok, DON\"T COME HERE.  We stayed here a few times a few years back, when we had more time. It's been a busy few years, so when we have a few days free, we thought, let's try the Pinnacle again. We booked one of the nice private villas, which are located in a quiet and scluded area about 200 meters from the hotel and about 350 meters from the beach.  Here is the problem: the Pinnacle opened a \"beach club\" right on their nice private beach (which used to be quiet). Now there is revolting loud dance music from about lunchtime until late at night. There is no escape. We tried walking down the beach a few hundred meters and we could still hear it. Lying in the hotel's beach area is really unpleasant. We had to watch lovely sunsets with appalling bass beats and offputting eurogarbage EDM. It must be truly awful if you stay in the regular rooms (the music goes quite late).  Many of the guests seem to like it. We for sure won't be back, ever.  The room was okay (pool villa). The music was audible in the pool villa area but not loud. The pools and other areas are nice. The staff are okay.  But please take heed: if you like quiet or feel annoyed by loud noise- avoid this place!! Supakorn wrote a review Dec 2019\n",
      "40 Perfect for the price This hotel is lovely. Four pools and beach access to the Gulf. The rooms are clean. The employees are friendly. The breakfast buffet, which is included, was good. We have enjoyed ourselves and will be back. melissasmith25 wrote a review Oct 2019\n",
      "30 Great Beach Club Pool Dumpty rooms. Nice views. Amazing Beach Club Pool! Average breakfast. Nice walk along the beach - very relaxing down there.

      "10 Not recommended Having previously stayed at the Pinnacle Bangkok about 3 years ago we decided to book a 3 night stay in the Pinnacle Pattaya as we found it to be good value for money if not 5 star. The family room is a good size and a plus point but the rest of the service has not met our expectations, we arrived early at the breakfast room on the first morning to find some of the food in the warm trays was cold with a limited choice. We also noticed tables once vacated were not cleared for the next guests, and soon late arrivals needed to clear tables themselves. This is not acceptable and I have come to the conclusion that the staff at this hotel in general are lazy!  How other guests can give good reviews about this hotel is beyond me! Hence to say we will not book again, would rather pay more and receive a good standard of service. Would have loved to given a good review but not for this style of service sorry Pinnacle.

I stay at Pool View and quite impress because it's have a large balcony and tropical garden but for the tourist may concern about eating because have a few shop around hotel and just 1 restuarant but not concern about eating because you can walk about 1.5 kilometre to marketing that have any kind of fool, in first day I have a dinner with Thai food and second day I have fish and ship and include shrimp tempura that my meal just about 150 for second day.

      "40 Quiet and Relaxing First mistake was getting a transfer to the wrong hotel. There is also a hotel called Grand Jomtien Palace which is 15 mins ride away from Pinnacle Grand Jomtien. Pinnacle Grand is also in Na Jomtien which is 15-20 mins from Pattaya and 5 mins from the real Jomtien beach strip.  The resort was really nice. Multiple pools and beach chairs to relax. It was quiet and peaceful and exactly the right place to chill out and read a book/ sunbake.  Staff were really friendly and accommodating too. Thanks Sumalee! I tried to go direct through the hotel to book another night but the ‘walk in’ prices are more expensive than on trip advisor and booking.com. I thought that was strange. Be sure to check out the neighboring restaurants like Glasshouse on the beach :) Tara L wrote a review Jan 2019\n",

Cocktails are also very delicious! ;-)  We enjoyed great time here but the region around jomtien and Pattaya offers a lot of exiting adventures as well.  The stuff is absolutely friendly and helpful.  English is no problem! Especially Miss Paychat helped us a lot and we are very thankful that she hosted us! She is born in Thai and grown up in Germany, that’s why we could also speak in perfect German! She organized a lot for us and we really had the feeling to be welcome! So at this Point again many thanks for your obligations Nam!  I am going to stay at pinnacle resorts again!    Many greets to the whole stuff and especially Nam!

      "40 Wonderful Resort at Super Price Checked into a bungalow that I found for a superb off-season price. Room showed hints of a decade or so of age but had been about half modernized. No complaints. The bungalow had its own front porch and was in a quiet gardened area. Most bungalows had a porch-front pool that snaked through the area offering everybody quick access to a cool down. The grounds were exceptionally beautiful and resembled almost a botanical garden. They had a small bird zoo and several ponds with fish to add to the jungle ambience. The hotel had a peace and tranquility, plus an laid back vibe that is not available in more built up areas around Pattaya. The breakfast buffet was as good as i had hoped but did not have much locally inspired cuisine. The restaurant was good and well priced. Beach area was quiet and no hawkers or noisy jet skis or boats. A small cafe on the beach served coffee and drinks and could bring food to you from the main restaurant. There is nothing to really do within walking distance though. And the area around the hotel is a little shabby for taking a stroll. There are a few small stores and a good massage shops next to the resort. I used a taxi to get around and usually had to call for one. It usually took less than 10 minutes for one to arrive and one way to Jomtien took about 12 minutes and cost 7 US dollars. I saw plenty of people walking out to the main highway to attempt to save some money and flag down cheaper transportation. The hotel and service is very good. But, having stayed in top tier hotels, I would not say that it is up to those levels of almost perfection. It is at a notch just below that, and considering price, the Pinnacle Grand Jomtien is hard to beat. RodgerJ wrote a review Oct 2018\n",
      "30 Peaceful & Tranquil, but not suitable for Vegetarian Indians Visited this property after reading a lot of great reviews on the Internet. So, had kind of very high expectations. But this is a good option if and only if you are not vegetarian and like staying away from the hustle & bustle of the day. Sharing here few pros and cons on the basis of experience of an Indian Vegetarian :    Pros:  • Very peaceful and quiet  • Private Beach  • A couple of small but good massage centres adjacent to the property  • Check-in was fast and smooth and early too, without any hassle  • Own beach beds and towels available free of charge.    Cons:  • No vegetarian options other than a couple like veg pizza, French fries  • No Indian restaurants in the vicinity, which could serve as a setback for vegetarian Indians.  • Far from main Pattaya, Walking Street.  • Shuttle service is available, but expensive @ 80 Baht per person, one way ; and cab costs around 300 Baht, one way, to reach Central Pattaya.    Washrooms also not as per Indian standards.  • Even though the rates are not very high but the actual overall stay costs more due to extra charges like transfer to main Pattaya everyday, no food options in the vicinity...etc. Even beach is not as great inspite of comfy sunbeds, towels and a bar on site.    Might have given a 4star rating if I were non vegetarian.  These are my personal thoughts based on my experience. No offence intended to anyone.    Would rather stay at Central Pattaya than here. guptaeti wrote a review Sep 2018\n",
      "50 Looking forward to visiting Pinnacle Grand Jomtien Resort next year! During my holiday in Pinnacle Grand Jomtien Resort, I was constantly noticing how great Sumalee performs her daily tasks at the reception. She was always kind, competent and polite, helping all the people with a smile in all kinds of circumstances. Whenever I had a question, she would always patiently explain. Hence, it was always nice to deal with her. I am definitely looking forward to staying at your hotel and meeting Sumalee once again. Lyudmila_Yass wrote a review Sep 2018\n",
      "40 Good but room for improvement First the good things. The whole is set up really nice. 3 pools, lots of green. The room we had was modern and clean and had a nice balcony. The bathroom was clean and modern. The breakfast was great, plenty of choice for everyone. We had dinner once and that was pretty good as well.. The beach is nice and even the wifi works there. Service was good too.    Some downsides were that during low season quite a lot of places are closed so nearby places to go are limited and in the evening there is not much to do. The nice looking trees also meant the tables and chairs were full of bird poo. And we have seen quite a few cockroaches near the restaurant. Apparently because of misbehaviour of guests in the past some weird rules were in place. Like no bags allowed at breakfast and a whole booklet on the beach towel/beds system.    The place is also quite far from Jomtien and Pattaya. Shuttle bus service is provided and works ok but is quite expensive. The hotel refuses to call a cab as they have their own in house travelling agency which takes full advantage of their monopoly by overcharging a lot. They charged us 400 bat to Jomtien, the tuk-tuk back cost us 20.    All in all if you are looking for a nice place to relax and don't want to move too much it is a good and affordable place. pafbuddy wrote a review Aug 2018\n"

The manager upgraded us to a better room at his own suggestion as a patch on the wound. Location wise it is a bit far from Jomtien City center so this place is perfect for couples and families who wants a quiet and stress free stay. Although the hotel offers car service to Jomtien and Pattaya. A shuttle buss is also available. We did not try dinner but the breakfast had all the necessary food items for both children and adults. 3 swimming pool and a private beach at your disposal. Good value for the money!

      "30 Getting old and loosing its charm Pinnacle resort certainly used to be a nice hotel, and since last year they unfortunately built a kind of convention center on the lawn near the beach!  It looks like the management needs to attract more business as the hotel is getting old; It’s a pity as the pool is big and nice, there is a green environment with lawn and plants, the restaurant has good variety of food, and the staff is really friendly.  Pinnacle has a fair price/quality quality, but should be upgraded .... Phil wrote a review Jul 2018\n",
      "40 \"FAMILY-FRIENDLY HOLIDAY RESORT\" \"LUXURY POOLS!\" \"CHARMING\" LOCATION    Google map is confusing. There are 2 Pinnacles listed: Pinnacle Grand Jomtien Resort and Pinnacle Resort. We walked from the highway to Pinnacle Grand by the beach. As there is also a Pinnacle Villa, we were misguided to follow the Pinnacle Grand Jomtien Resort at the Beach.    Our first impression was thus unpleasant. Both staff manning the beach pub and the security at the gate insisted we walk all the way around the premises on the main road to get to reception. We should have just walked through the resort pathway. It would have been quicker and easier. We had a luggage on wheels, which was no good on the beach sand, so we lugged our luggage above the sand and walked the tar road all the way around the resort! LUDICROUS!    SERVICE    At reception, we voiced our complaints to Miss Ann, assist guest relations officer and the reception clerk, who were disinterested. They asked how we arrived, by taxi? No we said, we walked from the highway! So walking around in PINNACLE circles was extremely agitating and annoying.  Then they asked for our passports, referring to us as a couple, BUT they gave us twin beds in Room 1120! The stench of the room was unbearable, with mold and grime evident in the bathroom. The room looked like it had not be occupied or cleaned in years! We immediately asked for another room, but with a double bed configuration. The bellboy went back to reception, then we were finally transferred to Rm 1437 in the new 6 storey building.    BREAKFAST    Good and wide selection of western, Thai and Chinese cuisine for a full breakfast. The area is charming and relaxing, with birds chirping in the background.    POOL    With 4 pools, the variety is luxurious, grand and fun! There were too many, we only dipped and dived into the pool near the new Beach Club under construction. The HIGHLIGHT of the pool was that one can dive and swim.The pool at the 6 storey white high rise also appeared inviting, as did the one outside the breakfast restaurant, but we were content with the pool of our choice and limited time-wise.    A hassle of the pool towels is that they are only offered at the pool near the Beach Club. One has to sign for the towels and also when dropping them off, otherwise a 400 Baht fine is charged. This is inconvenient for guests at either side of the resort, such as the beach or high-rise building, who have to walk half the resort just to get a towel. I would suggest keeping some at reception, and at the beach bar too.    ROOMS    The white high-rise building is new, hence the aircon is strong and bathroom is clean. The entire high-rise property had clean corridors and good maintenance.  The bed was comfortable but bathroom drain was clogged, so the water would rise to just under ankle length, despite there being no obstacle over the drain hole.    TENNIS COURT    Under renovation during visit    HOLIDAY RESORT    The resort itself is large, relaxing, peaceful and calm. There are 4 pools, a library, a mini-aviary, a fish pond and lush green gardens. The setting is serene and exquisite. Pity the seawater and beach is polluted, but humans are the guilty culprits. The water is not clear, but murky and there are rubbish floaters lying around.    One can take a stroll along the beach, or jog past numerous beach houses, hotels and tinhouses. The remote location of the resort is both a plus and minus. Guests are guaranteed seclusion, but transport is inconvenient, especially for budget travelers.    Business is booming (new beach club) as we observe busloads of tourists staying at this complex arriving late and departing early. The second group category are European families (Russian) travelling in unity, who just stay on the resort the whole day lounging at the beach or many poolsides. The disco music blaring keeps a party upbeat tempo, giving the middle pool area a funky atmosphere. One could lie on the recliner the entire day easily with a book.    MANAGEMENT    The next morning at breakfast, Miss Ann came over to ask how we were enjoying our stay. We informed her of the room issues, the disappointing service and how appalled we were with the state of the garden suite rooms. She promised to investigate with housekeeping.    The Resort Shuttle Bus service is not an attractive option at 80Baht per person for the ride to Mike Store. Other hotels offer FREE Songthaeu service, although granted for shorter distances.    SUMMARY    PLUS: Great Resort for FAMILIES! Multitude of POOLS!  MINUS: Service can be better! Remote location with transport costs unfriendly to budget travelers!    Recommendations for upgrading to SUPER RESORT :    Scooter or bike hire for individual travelers  Ping-pong table  Snooker table  Mini-golf    There is not much to do after 8pm (even the pool closes), thus adding other recreational facilities would be a BIG BONUS!    PK Versus PINNACLE BANGKOK LUMPINEE    Pinnacle Bangkok provides TOOTHBRUSH SET, has sauna, dirty white slippers with 200Baht charge if missing (see my review)  Pinnacle Jomtien has key cards, not door keys, has DIVING pool and brown, comfy slippers Kay L wrote a review Jul 2018\n",

      "20 Overpriced, disappointing room Whilst there was nothing really bad about the hotel, there was also nothing very good. The room was not in good condition, and felt old, with a stale smell. The shower only ran cold or scorching hot. The A/C was noisy, but the bed was ok.  The resort felt quite old and run down. The breakfast wasn't very good.

During our stay we encountered many different Staff from Management, to Maids, to Waitresses, to Bartenders etc and so on. All Greeted us with a Friendly Smile and a \"Sawadee Krup/Ka!\"    The whole Resort was spotlessly clean and well maintained including the Private Beach. All prices quoted for Food, Beverages, Room Service, Spa Treatments etc are INCLUSIVE of Tax etc which made for a very pleasant change when compared to Hotels/Restaurants elsewhere,    The Breakfast Buffet was Plentiful, Hot and Delicious with Great Waitresses ready to assist in any way possible.

      "50 Roaming retirees The staff were friendly and very eager to please. I have to give credit to a couple of the staff in particular SUMALEE & NISARAT who made my accommodations & transportation especially easygoing. The shuttle service to Pattaya was great, only wished I'd utilized it sooner during my stay. I would highly recommend the hotel's taxi service to the airport. I'd forgotten about this service when I arrived in Bangkok so took one of the pink taxis. Such a disappointment compared to my drive back to airport with the hotel taxi - definitely worth the little extra in cost. The cabanas on the beach were terrific! Listening to the sounds of the surf was the highlight for me, quiet beaches, easy & safe for solo walkers. Nice restaurants along the beach with wonderful sunset views I would recommend the Sea Falcon for dinner if you want something away from the resort. The buffets at the Pinnacle were great- tons of fresh food and large variety to choose from. The cleaning staff did a good job in the rooms as well as throughout the resort. The rooms aren't well insulated so if you're a light sleeper you may need ear plugs. But the noise was never excessive or too late at night. Listening to the sounds of nature as you fall asleep & awake is a marvellous thing! I would highly recommend this hotel ! Sandra J wrote a review May 2018\n",

      "50 A great two-night getaway Looking to get away from town for a couple of nights didn't want to go too far away we decided on the Pinnacle as it had its own private beach three swimming pools and very very reasonably priced compared on other hotels in the area. The hotel room while not huge was adequate in size with a large balcony overlooking the pool had all the amenities you could need hairdryer bathrobes in-room safe coffee maker with free coffee. Flat screen TV with plenty of channels and a restaurant with 24-hour room service which I might add was reasonably priced not your typical Hotel prices we use the room service twice food was very nice on both occasions. Breakfast buffet was included in the price and it was massive they had cereals yogurt fruit five or six different types of bread pancakes eggs and omelettes cooked-to-order cold cuts cheese salad area three or four different hot Thai food as well as all your normal breakfast food bacon potato Etc it lacked nothing very very nice. The staff at the Pinnacle as well very nice check-in went very smoothly when we were showing the room we were shown how things worked buy a very polite Bellboy. Just off the grounds of the hotel they have to massage parlors to mini-marts and a very short walk to the beach they have three or four different Thai style restaurants and the food was nice in the two that we tried as well as a restaurant called Drifters which specialized in western food.

We found the resort in an ideal location right on the beach, the staff were friendly and helpful and we enjoyed every minute.  The breakfast restaurant caters for all tastes and the food didn’t disappoint, we were always satisfied.  The room was clean and well maintained, we had a fantastic sea view.

      "40 Suitable resort for wheelchair user As a wheelchair user I am going to concentrate on disabled friendly aspects of the hotel in this review. The hotel has designated accessible rooms but these are in the standard category and it was my choice to have a Deluxe room for size and position. I immediately realised that the bathroom door was going to prove impossible to pass through with a wheelchair but housekeeping were very happy to agree to remove the door. The bathroom remained a tight fit and did cause issues throughout the stay. The room itself was also quite small, particularly for using a wheelchair. Because I need to use a wheelchair full time I probably would not choose to stay again only for those reasons, yet apart from that we had a very pleasant family holiday, with an adjoining room both with terraces overlooking the pleasant gardens near the main pool. I would recommend this hotel particularly to families. The grounds are very well laid out for wheelchair users and buggies, level and ramped. There were quite a few other wheelchair users staying while we were there.  We found the staff in the hotel to be exceptionally pleasant and helpful at all times. The rooms were serviced unobtrusively, and as soon as a ‘please clean’ sign was placed on the door. Unfortunately extra cleaning was needed due to illness at the end of our stay. We also needed to extend our stay for one extra night as I was unfit to travel. This was not a problem.  Breakfasts were adequate. It would be helpful to have more staff available at busy periods. The restaurant serves food all day which we found also to be satisfactory at times we ate there. Nothing exceptional though.  The hotel is situated on its own stretch of beach, which was kept clean. It is only from here in Na Jomtien, and continuing south that there begins to actually be any beach. Not that the sea is clean and inviting anywhere at the top of the Gulf. Stick to the pool. There is a useful little beach bar.  There are beach restaurants both north and south along the beach road within walking distance. Some top restaurants, others typical tiny beach bars. We avoided going in to Pattaya most of the time. There are many places to eat also a short drive away either in Jomtien or further south. Humbugcat wrote a review Jan 2018\n"

Good value for money, lovely private beach, nice clean pools and plenty of space so never seemed busy anywhere.  It's a taxi ride into the town but we didn't use this as just wanted a couple of beach days.

      "30 Convenient weekend escape from Bangkok with a fe drawbacks This is a three star resort for families as far as I’m concerned. And priced accordingly. You get what you pay for and that’s OK.    There are a lot of positive things speaking in Pinnacles favor: Friendly staff, clean rooms (we rented a hut which looks much nicer than the rooms inside the complex), and proximity to the beach. But first and foremost it’s an easy ride (2,5 hrs) from Bangkok rendering Jomtien the perfect weekend getaway place.    On the negative side: Beach and water is dirty with lots of plastics, aluminum, etc floating around. Water not clear either. Shame; otherwise we’d come back again but dirty water is the last thing you want on your getaway beach weekend.    Other trivia worth noticing: I guess 80% or more are Russians. Often families which makes it a non-party Hotel (good for us we just wanted relaxation) but you could go downtown to Pattaya if you get bored. (We didn’t). Also, the local restaurants have surprisingly good (and affordable) food whereas the hotel’s restaurants were definitely more pricey and not necessarily better.    If anyone from Managment reads this review I have a few tips to offer:  1. Make a deal with the other hotel owners to employ a dozen people or so who clean the beaches (not just your own little strip) every morning. We’re not talking big money...  2. Adopt a non-smoking policy within the hotel’s premises. It’s disgusting to have a quartet of chimney’s blowing tobacco in your (and your kids) face during breakfast.  3. Fine people for ditching their cigarettes on the beach. Very impolite.    Would we come back? Yes with 1-3 fixed as suggested above. Martin L wrote a review Jan 2018\n",
      "50 Great Service and Nice Hotel The good service started with the pick up service from DMK Bangkok airport for 4.200THB. The driver was there with a sign of our name directly at the exit. We drove in a climatized van to the hotel, and upon arrival the friendly staff already prepared everything for a quick check in. The room had everything you need.  The breakfast buffet had a rich selection and fresh made omelet.  The pools were clean and nice for a swim or relaxing.  The private beach had own sun beds, but make sure you book them in advance, and towels were given by hotel.  There are some nice restaurants directly beside the hotel, or you could enjoy the dinner buffet or a la carte at the hotels restaurant.  Grocery stores are directly beside the hotel as well as massage shops.  You can take the hotel owned van to Pattaya for 80THB/person which brings you directly to the busy area.    Overall, we enjoyed the quiet and nice location of the hotel, and for daily short trips the hotel has everything prepared for you, so you just need to select what you may be interested.    We can recommend the hotel and would go there again. davidco_1987 wrote a review Dec 2017\n",
      "50 Great services and good view We stayed at studio sea view room. Upon the check-in, the staff (Ms. Orawan) was very helpful and had great service mind. The room is clean and has a spectacular view of the beach and sunset. The hotel is next to the beach. We were satisfied with our stay and services we received. Kanokporn T wrote a review Dec 2017\n",

      "20 Motel resort style After reading some of the recent review on TripAdvisor with a 4 ratings plus it’s also rated as a 4 stars resort.....I was disappointed.    Although my Thai partner have booked me at the largest “family” apartment room, it felt cold and empty. Just a large room with plenty of space for you and your kids.    This place is frequented by German and Russian from the province and very casual. This you will feel if you wake up early to have breakfast by the poolside. Food is motel standard as with its presentation.    This place feels like a resort build with a motel concept and pricing. So if you feel comfortable with a more casual setting, I would recommend this place.    5 mins walk to the beach and poolside will remind you of a retirement home. Gym is about 30m2 with broken machine. It just feel un-love with paint chipped and dirty walls.    On the positive side, this is affordable for visitor who would like to stay in Pattaya for long period. Also if you are looking for more recline experience and love to be casual, you will fit in really well. Chris Y wrote a review Nov 2017\n",
      "40 Great food Stayed for 4 days at the hotel. It consists of several areas and we were booked in the white unit closest to reception.(no sea view) Rooms are a little outdated but was at least clean. The resort area is nice and on a large compound. There are several pools and a nice beach area. They are building a new beach bar and be aware of construction on the beach area. Its better to eat at the hotel and we found the prices very reasonable with great food. Breakfast was a rush with too many guests taking huge plates to their tables. The pancake machine did not work one morning but they served several other choices. Overall a relaxing get-away. Vansinsa wrote a review Nov 2017\n",

The selection in Breakfast is good with variety daily.    As water went down very slow in the hand wash sinks, we asked for changing room next morning. Their guest relationship officer re-assigned a room that has a double bed and a single bed that helped us more comfortable to sleep with a baby.

      "40 RAVING BORDERS ON LUNATIC Annually, for many years now, I have taken my family to Thailand during the summer low season. We do this for economic reasons and our stays have run the gamut from budget accommodations to promotional upgrades and suites, from rural locations to the heart of resort beaches and tourist traps    Never, in 17 years, have I had a better stay. It wasn't absolutely perfect, but it was the best vacation I've had yet.    Located on it's own private beach in Jomtien, The Pinnacle is an established resort, having been around for years. The building itself reflects this; it's apparent that it's older construction, a bit creaky and wear and tear is evident - if you look for it. And, for me, that adds an element of charm.    But it's also apparent that management and ownership have ensured the facilities are up-to-date and code. I had no apprehensions of boarding my family here. None.    As I mentioned, we came during low season and the grounds are surrounded by the typical lushness of Thai vegetation, so bugs (particularly mosquitoes) can be an issue. But they're mitigated by a couple common sense precautions, such as body sprays and taking your pool towel back to your room, where you drop it in front of your room door to block the bottom, where the pests tend to enter from. Fold the towel longways (to get enough length to cover the width of the door) and pack it up against the door tightly. Do this from the outside of the door so it doesn't get swept around (door opens into the room) and the staff will leave it there, as it's a practice seen around the entire hotel. And that's it. This is the only drawback. I'm serious; this was the only aggravation. And it's minor.    The rooms themselves are ordinary, not exceptionally large or anything. The beds were quite comfortable and there's free wifi in every room (each with it's own log-in). it's my opinion that these are the only things that matter in a room at a resort. If you're concerned with television reception or room service, I don't think a resort is where you should be. But that's MHO.    Pools. They're everywhere. All shapes and sizes (and depths). I have one gripe here and it's not because of the Pinnacle; it's every hotel in Thailand and that's the amount of chlorine in the water. If I can smell the chlorine before I get to the pool, you're using too much. Again, the Pinnacle was as guilty of this as the other two hotels we stayed at this year and every hotel we were at last year. I don't know why that is, but if other hoteliers are reading this review, throttle back on the chemicals. Thankfully, because of the pristine, private beach here... not much time was spent at the pools.    The onsite dining facility was excellent! There is, what I would describe as a mini-village... adjacent to the hotel, with a number of shops and restaurants (because the resort is a bit in the sticks, so you're a drive from anything resembling a downtown). The Glass House (top-drawer dining) is a 10 minute walk up the road, but a bit on the pricey side. It also has it's own private beach, but there are a number of Thai eateries on the beach, if you take the walk, but I digress...    Just about any hotel worth it's salt offers the \"free breakfast.\" Let me tell you something; most of those \"free breakfast\" buffets border on yuck and worse.    The \"free breakfast\" buffet at the Pinnacle? I would have paid. Man, it just blew us away. We've stayed at hotels where your individually-ordered omelet was prepared by someone \"in training\" and usually with just a cart and a hot plate. Not at the Pinnacle; here you get someone who knows what they're doing and they have the entire kitchen at their disposal. You can order your eggs any type, style, size, whatever... and it's done perfectly. The spread is a site to behold; every conceivable menu item is there and you can have it your way, all free, all morning.    The grounds of the hotel are manicured, as expected. The free-roaming exotic birds were not. Let that marinate.    The beach... oh my...    Clean, groomed and watched. Yes. By security personnel. So that you can leave your stuff on the chair and wade out, without having to worry if it'll remain unmolested and there when you get back. Give 'em a tip and your stay will extrapolate to something equivalent to diplomatic levels. The beach bar staff as well.    While we're on that subject, let's talk about the staff.    Hotel staffs run the gamut of human nature; some excel and some don't. Some enjoy their work and some endure. I don't need to stay in hotels to experience these differences; you can see them at work or at the local supermarket.    There was something different about this staff. Yes, they smiled constantly, as is normal for Thai people. But this was different. This was joy. This staff laughed when we joked, they waid when we came and left and they made it their mission to make sure we were comfortable and that went from the room service to the front desk. Courteous. And respectful. And management was seen, walking around, greeting customers and making everyone's day as best as possible.    I could go on (as if I'm not already) but I think it's clear by now that this was the best stay my family and I have ever experienced in all of our travels.    If you're going to be in-country and in the area during low season and need exceptional accommodations without the exceptional prices, I emphatically recommend The Pinnacle. Hit the beach, order your preferred adult beverage and let it all go.    They'll have your back. matsellah wrote a review Aug 2017\n"

      "40 Really pleased with this hotel We booked on the morning of arrival. We checked in early and the staff were very nice and helpful and did there best for us not to have a long wait. Very efficient.  The hotel is in lovely grounds leading to the sandy beach. 2 large pools which I went in both. Breakfast was very good. Lots of choice, of course buffet style so not for the customer who wants serving freshly cooked food.  The Spa is definitely worth a visit. The 2 ladies there gave a very good foot massage.  The reception team organised a taxi to take us to the floating market, a large boat selling lots of gifts, also worth a visit.  I will be back. Di brooks wrote a review Aug 2017\n",

      "50 Memorable Vacation at the Pinnacle Jomtien Resort We stayed in 3 family rooms, 2 of which were in the ground floor with direct access to the swimming pool. The rooms were huge, clean well maintained and were located just above the car park which was very convenient as we had 2 rented cars.    The beach was a 3 minute walk from our rooms. The beach front was nice but the water didn't look clean, although through no fault of the hotel. This was however more than made up for by the very nice pools and warm hospitality by the hotel reception staff. Thank you Ann, Sumalee, Tip and Ongkalak for making our stay at the Pinnacle a most enjoyable one.    The buffet breakfast was very good. The usual american breakfast fare of sausage, bacon, eggs, pancakes and ham were lavishly complemented by Asian/Thai stews, noodles, stir-fried veggies, fried rice and congee. Thanks to the very attentive and helpful dining staff led by Supanee, Kanyani, Doungkeawand Bukara.    We will come back again if only for the wonderful staff of this hotel. eor0101 wrote a review Jul 2017\n",

      "20 Lot's of broken sunbeds in the garden and at the beach of this old resort Read till the end, I will get to the sunbeds below:    When I read some other reviews I really wonder if the people were in the same hotel as I was. My experience in Pinnacle Grand was really bad. The furniture in our room was old and the room was dirty. Our first room also had a dirty toilet which didn't flush and a lamp broken as well as almost no water coming out of the shower.    After we mentioned that it took the staff over 1 hour to get us settled into a new room. The new room was in one way nice as it had sea view, but the furniture was the same. The room still had sand from the last person who stayed there on the floor, it was supposed to be clean. At that point I really wanted to get to the beach so I didn't say anything again.    A note to the hotel here: PLEASE clean the phones in all your rooms and the wood above the beds and other interior in the rooms. I do want to believe that our bed sheets were clean but the rest of the room from both rooms I have been in was filthy!    Now to the sunbeds: Half of all sunbeds in the garden and on the beach were broken and also the shades were mostly broken! This should not be in a 4 star hotel. If you don't believe me, I took pictures... It can happen that one or two sunbeds are broken but not half. I felt 'ashamed' for this hotel! LoveThaiifoodAndMore wrote a review May 2017\n",
      "40 A decent 3 star hotel resort on the beach Hello, the Pinnacle is a decent get away from Bangkok for those that live here and need a quick escape. The resort is south of Pattaya, away from the noise and traffic. It is a lively hotel with middle class Thai families mixed with half dozen tourists. The beach is clean, quiet and well laid out with umbrellas and chairs. The grounds are fairly well kept and the pools are clean. Although a bit dated, everything was in working order and no shoddy repairs etc.  Though a bit busy, the morning breakfast buffet was decent, coffee, eggs to order, indoor/outdoor seating, plenty of staff etc.  Rooms were a decent size, 40sqm, clean, renovated bathrooms, safe, etc.    Next to the hotel from the beach are two decent restaurants, one; Bacco, the same owners as the Thonglor, Bangkok one. and The Glass House- which was a fairly impressive Thai restaurant. very family oriented.    Approx 2 hrs drive from BKK. WallySantana wrote a review May 2017\n",

      "50 Fantastic family resort, right on the beach. The location is excellent, right at the beginning of Na Jomtien. The resort is set back so you have the spacious rooms, each with their own balcony centred around a lovely tropical garden and a small relaxing pool. There is also a full-sized pool, then a lovely lawn with plenty of sun-beds and finally a private beach with sunbeds. Unlike Jomtien and Pattaya beaches, there is no beach road, which makes it very peaceful and secluded. We hired a car but the resort offers shuttles into town if needed.  Breakfast buffet was excellent and so too was the evening restaurant. The staff spoke very good English and were very helpful. Kevin H wrote a review Apr 2017\n"

      "40 Nice 5 star facilities hotel - mid-range price in a quiet area of Jomtien Beach While booking thru Tripadvisor link (linked to Agoda.com), I have a choice of Garden villa or pool view room facing room at the same price of USD61 (before tax, weekday.) I picked the Garden villa. The villa is across a road from the main hotel property. The whole villa complex is beautifully designed and felt secluded (compared to the main hotel with 4 floors). The problem for my villa numbered 3173 is that once I got inside I found 4 mosquitoes were flying around (I immediately got bitten). I phoned the housekeeping to apply mosquito spray and solved the problem. The maid tends to open all window and door while they clean the room daily. I would recommend this property as the similar quality hotel in USA would be 3 to 5 times the cost.    The first night we stay there was no hot water (regular tap cold water) even though I tried to turn the water faucets different direction running the water for 5 minutes. It was too late at night 10pm to called for maintenance man to fixed it. The hotel front desk agreed to fix it next day at 10am. However, after a breakfast and swim at the beach and back at 12 noon to the room the problem was not fixed. So I phoned again and finally the maintenance came and do whatever they do (may be changing a hose or turn on the hot water valve somewhere outside) and we finally get ourselves clean off the seawater with hot water shower.    I do not understand why the receptionist had to give me the very last villa closest to the west end. In the day time all I hear is the banging noise from the construction of the next door high rise building. I came here for my vacation and stay in this facilities and I saw a few other villas further away that are vacant. I cannot figure out why when there is empty villas and I was assigned to the villa that is going to get disturbed by the noise. Since this is the last villa next to the west end entrance area, you can also hear the chatting of the janitors. I can accept the fact that if all the villas were fully occupied then this villa numbered 3173 is the only last one available. It could be that the receptionist stick by the rules that those villas further away from the noise are worth a few dollars more and so even if there are empty the hotel is not going to give it to me.    Buffet dinner at the restaurant is 499 baht/person which is quite expensive. However, a 2 to 4 minutes stroll (depending on how fast you walk) you will reach the row of restaurants by the beach (look up google map). I particular like the Drifter Pizza. A cozy nostalgic shack that the light sea wave sound sooth you just a few meters away.    The hotel is charging 3000 Baht to hire a taxi to the airport and you need to book one day ahead. While you can take a chance to order UBER ride that charge anywhere from 600 to 1000 Baht. However, sometime UBER shown no car available.    This hotel cater to Russian clienteles arriving in tour buses. In the morning breakfast area all I saw was some 100 Russians and hardly any Asian. So you will missed some of the loud chatting Chinese tourist group that swamp the central Pattaya city area.    I read 4 pages of Tripadvisor reviews and had to agree that the staff in this hotel need more training on offering more hospitality to the guests. They pass you by without acknowledging you as if you are a stranger on the road. A smile or having eye contact and nob on the head or wave is a simple gesture to show some warm and welcome. I would send the management to stay one night at the Citrus Parc Hotel Pattaya to learn how they treat their customers.    The sea water in front of the hotel beach is not as clear due to the fine sand that suspended in the water. At times due to the current it received the discharge from the estuary nearby.    One advise: bring and apply your DEET mosquito repellent.    Too bad that my travel schedule is not flexible. On my search for 4 nights the price came up to be USD51; 3 nights USD60 and 2 nights USD63. So, if you want to stretch your dollar a longer stay may be your option if you prefer quiet area. Your mileage may varies pending on weekday or weekend and travel seasons.    The big pool towards the beach can be deep (I guess it is 3 meter deep) and it is the most popular of the 3 pools plus a kid pool (not counting those pools in the separate Garden Villa area). There is also a facilities close to this pool for the morning Yoga.    I forgot where I read on the internet that this is one of three hotels that has a private beach in the Jomtien beach area. So, search and take your pick. Overall, you should try for at least one night here and decide for yourself. This is a 5 star rated facilities hotel and even for dis-satisfied guest would still fetch 4.5 star. baketown89 wrote a review Mar 2017\n",

Pros:  Private beach  Workout facilities  On site massage spa which is cheap and when offered a massage in the pavilion on the beach is very relaxing  Two pools, one with a toddler pool  Sliding board and toddler toys  Plethora of chaise lounges and towels  Lovely gardens  Quiet and off the beaten path  Decent on site restaurant    Cons:  Far from public transport so you need a car or to hire someone to go out  Older so the mattress needs replacing I could feel the springs when sleeping as well the chaise lounges and huts over them are not in great shape Nikki J wrote a review Mar 2017\n",

      "30 Not for the Bachelors :) We, a group of 5 guys, stayed here two nights last month - Dec 2016. The resort is spread over acres, has two or three pools and a private beach. But I wouldn't recommend this resort for bachelor and first timers to Pattaya! It's kind of isolated from the main city and it's not easy to commute without a bike or cab. There are very few shops nearby and needless to say most of them are massage parlors. There is no good restaurant and so you will have to rely on the resort restaurant! The complimentary breakfast didn't have any veg option except slices of bread! The hotel staffs are also not friendly especially the receptionist. She wasn't even ready to help us to make a phone call to a local shop! The shuttle trips are also expensive. So go for a hotel in the city that's close to Jomtein!

      "20 Ruby wedding vacation We stayed at the Pinnacle Grand for 6 nights, we booked the hotel independently without an agent.    Within the first few minutes we realised that this place attracted huge numbers of Russian tourists, this in turn has had a negative affect on the staff, the welcome was quite frosty and business like, the receptionist definitely hadn't been to charm school, not the usual Thai smile, we were given the obligatory cold towel and welcome drink, this was followed by 'give me passport and credit card' a wrist band was thrust on our arms with the comment 'you lose this it cost 500baht, you wear at all time round pool and for breakfast', this came across as quite abrupt, however we were yet to meet the masses of rude guests at breakfast, there are instructions in the room about breakfast food to only be consumed in the restaurant, not that it stopped these guests having a takeaway. Breakfast is the usual buffet affair, nothing particularly good or bad, but if you like people watching this is the place to be, these coach loads of tourists pile their plates so high you would think there was about to be a world food shortage, they are rude to the staff, and the smell of body odour gives away the fact that eating is top priority for these folk, rather than a shower before breakfast to make it a more pleasant experience for the rest of us.    We were eternally grateful that we'd paid the extra for a pool villa, as this meant we could escape the noise and melee around the pool, not having to fight for a lounger as we had our own outside the room, this was relatively peaceful for reading and sunbathing.    Another good point is that a lot of these tourists for some unknown reason like to just sit in the sea up to their necks throughout the day, like monkeys in a hot spring, thus vacating the pool area, probably for the best as we were shocked that bikinis are available in such enormous xxxxxL sizes.    The room was good, excellent air conditioning, kept clean each day by the staff who were friendlier than the receptionist, although there is one of those 'we like to care for the environment' notices in the room stating that they won't be changing the bed linen every day unless you request, and for stays of more than 3 days they would change the sheets after 3 days, we were here 6 nights and I know the bed linen was only changed the day before we left.    You need to be aware that this hotel is off the beaten track, there is an estuary that cuts the area off from the rest of Jomtien beach and Pattaya, causing a considerable journey to get to either of these.    The hotel provides a shuttle service into Pattaya at 80baht per person one way that you can book at the tour desk, although the guy on the tour desk wasn't great at counting how many tickets he sells, one occasion we all had to pile off and get in a bigger bus, we also witnessed a Russian guest get within 2 inches of a mini bus drivers face trying to intimidate him because he didn't  understand what the driver was saying, Thai people are a very gentle people and we were shocked at this disgusting rude behaviour.    There are a few shops and restaurants nearby, though we wouldn't recommend the massage, not unless you are fond of old ladies attempting to cripple you with their elbows dug into your muscles.    Laundry service nearby is a rip off, not the usual Thai service by the kilo but charged by the item.    I have made a note of all the tour operators that book for these large groups and will check in future whether they use a particular hotel before we book to avoid this type of guest in future, as I am well aware that the hotel has no control over the bad behaviour of their guests.    We won't be back. Lindyann2013 wrote a review Jan 2017\n",
      "30 Not bad If you are looking for a lonely space bungalow, this is not the right hotel for you.    The next bungalow is 2 m away and in the opposite bungalow you can see the minibar. \"Joking\".    If you turn on aircondition you can not hear any outside noise.    The breakfast has been visited from may be 200 guests same time than us... its like on a battle field.    Not bad at all... but not more than 3 stars. Socrates010160 wrote a review Jan 2017\n",
      "30 Good but not a 4 star We enjoyed our stay at this older property but beds/pillows not suitable & water went hot to cold back n forth even after maintenance came. The family room is large with plenty of room for kids, excellent service, beautiful grounds, pool and beach. The price was reasonable as well, but we won't stay there again due to the beds/pillow.

      "20 Garden villa - not money worth Booked a garden villa. Checked in reception was not friendly and had to wait for 15 minutes for buggy to ferry us to the villa. Reception didnt offer any drinks while we waited at buggy waiting area. Room air con compressor was super noisy and interrupted our sleep. Room was below average for the price paid. Not recommended for the price for the villa. eddy wrote a review Jan 2017\n",
      "10 Spa Do not use spa it's a complete rip of :( They had 20% off so I asked price for oil massage which they said 280 only to be charged 640 baht double anywhere else. Very dishonest I think :( I run my own business and I think this type of behaviour is unacceptable. Clarejordan94 wrote a review Dec 2016\n",
      "30 Ok but nothing more I'm usually a really easy guest to please as long as the rooms clean, has good A/C and the staff are friendly I'm happy.    We arrived around midday and our room wasn't ready which wasn't an issue and was soon ready. We were taken to our room (The old side) and was immediately concerned that the room was very different to the pictures on Agoda, The room we had was extremely dated and had a smell to the room. We decided that we weren't happy where we were and went to reception and had a chat with the reception they agreed that the room was Miss-sold and moved us to a new room which was a lot cleaner and modern, however we had to single beds in this room and no towels, Reception once again sorted this quickly. The final issue we had was no hot water for our evening shower which was a shame this was however sorted by the morning.    Overall a fairly good stay however room for improvement, the beach is nice and there are some good places too eat within walking distance, some good local massage parlours and a few taxi places which will take you to Bangkok if required.    Breakfast is also ok however it is extremely busy! Sam C wrote a review Dec 2016\n",
      "50 Gave it the best possible note but it deserves more! Definitely recommended. We visited this hotel twice and it was (both times) one of the best experiences we have ever had, where hotels and resorts are concerned.    The hotel itself is located a few kilometers from Pattaya and a few hundred meters from the main road, so if you want to visit the city frequently it might not be the best option, although there are buses coming and going from the hotel to Pattaya. However, if you are looking for peace and quiet it is just perfect.    There are a few shops and small restaurants next to the resort, there are usually taxis at the hotel lobby.    The rooms were spacious, modern and very clean, the staff were cleaning them daily.    We have only had breakfasts, so I cannot tell anything about other meals, but where breakfasts are concerned I have to say that I have never had a better experience. The variety of foods is unparalelled and the quality is in my opinion very good.    The hotel has its own beach, you can borrow towels.    The only problem (if one really wants to find something) is that sometimes the staff did not communicate well in English, but it is only a really insignificant thing.

      "40 Good value for money To rightly Describe it's a 5 star property at 4/3 star rates. Beautifully made. Staff courteous, neat and clean rooms. They have 3 swimming pools. Beautiful garden. Have morning yoga classes. Lots of massage parlors nearby. Huge property. Breakfast served was reasonably lavish. It's good place for families or couples wanting to enjoy quite holiday. It's probably not for party people. The water at beach didn't look very clean, bt there were people enjoying. Sea sports available in area around and few reasonably priced beach restaurants nearby. Walking street Pattaya is approx 10 km. You can hire taxi for dropping and picking up at approx 500 bahats khadds wrote a review Nov 2016\n",
      "40 Great resort for a relaxing stay. We stayed here for 2 days, while visiting a friend in the area.    The resort is easy enough to find, signposted off the main Sukhumvit Road.    It has three parking areas and we never had problems finding somewhere to park.    In general, the resort is well maintained to a good but not excellent quality standard. Some tiles are mis-aligned and rough edges can be seen here and there but it is perfectly adequate for all but the fussiest.    Checkin was swift, friendly and efficient. Prior to checkin, the hotel had already impressed me by balling to arrange a cake and flowers for my wife, as it was her birthday. Both were waiting for us, nicely presented, in the room.    We chose a Garden Villa, across the road, in a secure area. The garden is lovely, well maintained. The villas are arranged around a river-like swimming pool and many have direct access to the pool. The villas are simple, with a large, well air conditioned bedroom, adjacent shower/restroom and veranda. A TV, with channels in Thai, Russian, Dutch, English and some other languages is available.    The grounds are large and pleasant, with 2 communal swimming pools, a large garden leading to a private beach. There are plenty of loungers and staff are available to serve you smoothies, coffee and snacks.    Breakfast is good, with a good selection and a very good egg chef, who cooks excellent omelette and poached eggs.    In general, the staff are excellent, well trained and provide very good, attentive service.    Location is ok, a 20 min drive from central Jomtien.    We enjoyed our stay and will return. markjholloway wrote a review Nov 2016\n",

      "30 Hotel Pinnacle Grand, Jomtien Beach. It is a clean family kind of place and away from the noise & bustle of the cliched Pattaya! It has a private beach besides a swimming pool, spa etc. The Breakfast is free and very wholesome with a huge array of items. The room overlooks the sea and there is a sense of calmness. There are many kinds of food to order from the a la carte at any time. there is also a huge buffet served up for dinner to enjoy. Falguni B wrote a review Nov 2016\n",
      "50 Mesmerizing! This is a luxury city in itself! We had dream sea facing rooms on the 3rd floor and we could see the picaresque sunset right from the lanai itself overlooking the private beach.  The beach is very well maintained and that is very important as Jomtien is way outside Pattaya and the beach maintenance is not good in general. There are two swimming pools and one has a baby pool as well. The larger one has a pool side bar and is located at the backdrop of the beach and grounds.  Rooms are spotless and room service was great as well.  Breakfast spread was never ending! And frankly I do not remember all the items, we were spoilt for choices - beefs, porks, noodles, hams, sausages, fishes, eggs per choice, bacons, veggies, salads, fruits, juices, rice, yoghurts and what not!  The travel desk is very helpful as well, they arranged a mini van for us in just an hour for the Pattaya drop. Rates are reasonable too.  The check in was smooth! We arrived at about 9:30 AM. Check In time was 12:00 PM but the lady tried her level best and gave us the room by 11:15 AM.  Food ordered via room service is very good and is more or less same price as that of other restaurants in Jomtien area. Somnath B wrote a review Nov 2016\n",
      "30 Good. Relaxing place. A place. Where you can relax. 10 -15 km away from pattaya central. Has intermittent internet. Problems. But who wants to be bothered while on holiday. And a unusual buffet dinner sometimes but then it is relaxing to know that the staff are. Very good at solving problems but other than that I really had a great time. In a great room and was well relaxed. When I left . Swam in a warm pool after a cold sea. GREAT PLACE. Ant J wrote a review Oct 2016\n",
      "30 New Year Eve at Pinnacle Attracted by quote \"Good Guys go to Heaven ,Bad Guys go to Pattaya, we decided to try the taste of New Year EVe in Pattaya. We stayed in Hotel Pinnacle Jomtien during this trip.    When we first reached the hotel,we had impression the hotel is not convenient,but later we realised the hotel is located within walking distance from Pattaya City.    Moreover,it has its own beachfront.On the new year of 2015,they had their exclusive private event which the visitors may join to avoid the bustling crowd along Jomtien beach.    We love the breakfast place surrounded by lushful tropical garden and palm trees.Relaxing by the pools and jacuzzi within the garden was definately a five star experience.    We would come back again. Roving675646 wrote a review Oct 2016\n",
      "50 Honey Moon in Pinnacle We visited Pattaya in October'15. It was a wonderful trip to Thailand and Pinnacle hotel contributed a lot.  Own clean beach, very nice silent place, friendly staff.  We were lucky to get an excelent room in a building we assessed as the best one to live in. In addition, we received a special gift from hotel manager Luciano when he becomes aware of our recent marriage - it was very-very nice! :)  Hotel has a good restaurant with different food for any choice. It was not the best time of the year (not a peak season) and the majority of local neighbor shops and restaurants were closed. But it impacted us not very much.  So in a nutshell it was exactly what we dreamed about planning our honey moon.  And yes, we are going to visit it again if our travel choice will fall again on Pattaya.

      "20 In theory the hotel has a lot going for it but let down by poor performance in key areas. Poolside villa good value and a rare highlight.  Breakfast okay but on two or three occassions the facilities were swamped with people because hotel had allowed conference personnel to use along side hotel guests-net result was difficulty finding a table and snake like queues for the buffet food.  Dinner service, menu and quality of food was very poor-net result was hotel guests used alternative external restaurants. Clearly therefore numbers actually using the hotel dining room were low.  Private beach, great idea but let down by worn out sunshades and sun beds. Service by hotel staff only available on the first day?  Unfortunately the beach was dirty.

It is away from the busy Pattaya and family friendly. Breakfast was great, there are many cheaper local restaurants only walking distance from hotel, with beautiful sunset views. staiby wrote a review Aug 2016\n",

It's a tad far from the main tourist street, but you can easily catch a taxi downtown. I wouldn't stay there again, but if you're looking for a budget place along the beach, it's acceptable, quiet and private. Stacia R wrote a review Sep 2016\n"

      "40 Nice modern-style hotel, hidden away in Soi 1 I found this hotel by chance looking for a pet friendly hotel when other so-called pet friendly places nearby turned out not to be so pet friendly. Don’t get me wrong, our dog is not the issue - he is young and very well-behaved as I’m sure all hotels we have stayed at will confirm.  I read some positive reviews online and tried this hotel, initially calling the number listed on their Facebook page. This turned out to be one of the owners I believe, and they confirmed that a dog would be no problem and they would tell reception to expect us. We visited the same day to view the room on offer and secured this for the next day with a deposit.  The hotel is hidden away on Jomtien Soi 1 and has its own parking area for several cars just up the road, which was perfect.  Cash was required at check-in to pay the room and dog fees (no credit card option).  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the room, especially as the rate was very reasonable. I understand the hotel was renovated around 2016, but everything in the room and public areas looked new and fresh. The bed was huge with good quality white duvet and sheets and contrasting blue cushions and the room was clean with tv and cable (channels from around the world), fridge, multi-block extension cable if required and a small wardrobe. The air conditioning worked well and was quiet. I also liked that although there was a key-card slot to turn electricity on, it was actually on all the time so if you wanted to leave the air conditioning on whilst out for dinner, you could.  There was no breakfast option offered but there are many places nearby that offer breakfast for around 100 baht up.  The bathroom, whilst quite small, was very clean and modern. The shower was a modern electric unit that provided a good supply of hot water, as hot as you like!!  A lot of hotels in Asia like to have a window between the bathroom and bedroom, which I find quite strange, and this room had such a window. There was a roller blind you could lower for privacy if needed, but unfortunately roller blinds and showers do not work well together and there was some mildew staining - not much - but why not just put film on the window to make it opaque? Easier to clean……  Staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel was not busy due to Covid restrictions affecting Thailand at the time.  There was no coffee or tea in the room, but in the lobby there was free coffee and tea available as well as a drinks vending machine. We did not need these as there were so many shops and bars/restaurants very close by, but nice to have available.  I believe there is a roof terrace area to sit and watch the sunset, at an angle, but we did not go to check this out on this visit.  As mentioned, the hotel is in Jomtien Soi 1, which is a quiet Soi - you can access from the beach road or from Sai 2 near the Rompho market. If you don’t know it’s there you would never stumble upon it, which makes it a bit of a hidden gem!! There are signs from the beach road.  I think this hotel deserves more business as it offers lovely fresh modern rooms at a very good rate and is close to all that Jomtien has to offer in terms of beaches, shops, nightlife, restaurants etc.  I read in a previous review that someone had a problem with a neighbours cock waking him up in the morning but I can say I did not hear anything like that. There were a few dogs in the Soi that barked at times but not a big problem. Our dog just looked out of the window at them in mild amusement (a bit more serious when we walked down the Soi but that’s another story….) Maybe the other reviewer had a room at the back of the hotel - our room was at the front.  I forgot to mention - the rooms in this hotel do not offer great views of the beach or anything as it is orientated at 90 degrees to the beach road. But if you want a clean, comfortable, good price room to sleep in, give it a try!!! mach2point0 wrote a review Jan 2022\n",
      "20 D for disappointing Pros - cheap, central, friendly reception.  Cons - Noise, Air-con no good, WI-FI no good, poor breakfast.    Feel I must give a true and honest review to save future tourists from this experience.  Woke up at 4am every morning with neighbours cock!  Crowing at first light... Extremely loud and continued for hours!  Air conditioning is totally inadequate and makes room conditions unpleasant.  Offered FREE WiFi but was very unstable all of the time.  Offered breakfast included... To be taken in a small glass fronted lounge area that was unbearable with heat and no air conditioning. Breakfast offered was soup and chicken sandwich.... Just what you need!!  Rooms were basic, shower area moldy and unpleasant.  Receptionist was as helpful as could be, but not able to resolve any of these issues. I would neither recommend or return to this property. Mark G wrote a review Dec 2019\n",
      "40 Excellent When you enter into the road maybe you’ll think how’ll be the hotel look like. But when you get at the entrance you’ll feel better. And yes when you enter the staffs will welcome you with a smile and though I booked the hotel online I was happy to see before going there they prepared our room already. The room ambience was awesome we were just impressed with the room and the blue color made us feel that yes we are in a beachside. The beach is just in a walking distance you can just go by the road and cross to go onto the beach. Everything was clean and they’ve bikes for rent. The breakfast was also good European style. The staffs are pretty helpful. Overall yeah I loved the hotel. If I visit pattaya I’ll definitely book this hotel again. tuhor7 wrote a review Jan 2019\n",
      "40 Note that this is in the Jomtien area This is a boutique hotel with a distinct charm. The thing I liked most about this hotel is the friendly and helpful staff. The room itself was clean and had the basic essentials. Being unfamiliar with the Pattaya area, I must say that I made a mistake by choosing this area (Jomtien) because my friend lives near the Walking Street area. Consequently, I needed to find transportation to and from and traffic after work is quite bad (requiring about 30 minutes). Rand U wrote a review Aug 2018\n",
      "50 Nice stay Whatever negative(only very few) I had read about this hotel turned out to be absolutely false.. we stepped in on 23rd March 2018 for two nights.  Located hardly 2 minutes from the Jomtien beach...rooms are quite spacious, clean and neatly organised. All the staffs are very courteous... Always a smiling face!! Breakfast is good..  Would recommend to any travellers.. Pallab S wrote a review Mar 2018\n",
      "50 The best hotel for its price We were at this hotel in february 2018 in amount of 7 people. We totally felt in love with this hotel. I f you look at the price and than compare it with 200 metres from the Jomtien beach, excellent hotel team and pretty awesome rooms for 2 star hotel, you will realise that this hotel worth even more than we spent there. Special thanks to the Fix, he was at the reception of the hotel. We would defenitelly advise this hotel and will back again. alexanddenis wrote a review Feb 2018\n",
      "40 Value for money Very nice and friendly staff. Great location. If you do not expect too much from the breakfast you will not be disappointed.24 hours coffee,hot water or tea. Very clean room. Value for money.New hotel. johnwittenberg wrote a review Dec 2017\n",
      "50 Highly recommended if you are on a budget Affordable hotel, clean, with new amenities, and the location’s great! Walking distance to Jomtien beach, restaurants, and 7/11. Access to public transportation is also just a 5 minute walk away. Breakfast can be improved, but I am not complaining. I can definitely say that you are getting much more for its price.

      "10 Terrible!!! Worst hotel i have lived in! Staff doesn't speak english, breakfast is very poor. They charge you for cleaning the room. For everytime you need a towel they charge you extra. Never coming back here. Do not recommend this hotel to anybody. karoander wrote a review Jan 2017\n",
      "30 Ok reception, ok room, but no view The main problem was the lack of view out from the room - looked straigth into the backyard where there was a 24/7 trim studio. Interesting street outside with all the local street food stands etc. Very central to the main streets :) Kjell T wrote a review Dec 2016\n"

      "30 Staff not very helpful I am normally not a negative reviewer, but this hotel got me pissed off. The room is very nice. Our room was clean and very spacious. Nothing bad about that. Although the staff was not very helpful. When i checked out i got problems already with the bike. They wanted the bike back that i rented the night before, told me it was for a whole day. We couldn't really communicate with each other in english. I know i should learn some Thai but if you work in hospitality, you should be able to understand a little bit of english. Anyways after a bit i could get the bike. And returning the bike they wanted a full tank inside the bike while I got the bike empty (?!) And i gave them a bike with half tank even! I don't think they intend to piss me off but a little bit of communication between the staff is not difficult i think. By that i mean they have different staff for day and night. The hotel is not bad. The staff could be a bit more nice and helpful. Conclusion is hotel is good. Staff not so. Kong77 wrote a review Nov 2016\n",
      "40 Affordable Affordable & Nice. New Beach With Walking Distance. Motorcycle Rental Available. By renting motorcycle easy to travel around. Room is nice enough. Access road to the Hotel abit poor. Nearby restaurant also affordable. Teoh Eng Tat wrote a review Nov 2016\n",
      "30 Not as nice as it looks in the pictures The truck we took to the hotel from the bus station dropped us off in front of the road that the hotel is on but there is no sign there. The hotel is not on the main road, which is nice. When we checked in around 9 PM, all three tables outside were occupied by smokers. The staff were neither rude nor friendly, though they did escort us to our room. I quickly noticed the mildew all along the bottom of the plastic shower curtain and that where the laminate floor met the tile didn't seem to be finished properly. The pictures here on Agoda don't show all the ways the hotel is poorly maintained. Also, we didn't feel that our room was well-cleaned. Our room was on the 7th floor where there was a balcony which had a few tables and chairs. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel, but we did eat our leftover Indian food for lunch, which the staff kindly heated up for us in the microwave in their kitchen. The breakfast area is cute and the hotel provides free coffee and tea all day though you have to use the cups they provide in your room. KaivalagiTraveler wrote a review Aug 2016\n",
      "30 Very clean new hotel We liked this hotel as very clean and good location Soi 1 jomtien  Plenty of parking for cars  But we didn't like the shower as water goes everywhere on bathroom floor  It's Not designed properly  Lift noise and doors slamming is annoying  Can hear everyone coming and going  Free coffee 24 hours a day but breakfast is a lucky dip what you receive everyday  Free breakfast included  What ever they feel like giving  You have no choice at all  Internet extremely slow  Sometimes can't use Internet as no connection Mayayaman wrote a review Aug 2016\n",
      "40 Clean, Quiet and homely. The hotel staff was very good and anticipated wifi issues even before we got to the room. They followed us through the room and showed condition of all items and facilities. Very thorough and polite. They even rented a scooter to me which was in good condition. Made sure my wifi was connected before they left the room. 5 Star service for a 2-3 star price!    Free Coffee & Tea 24/7!! Balaselvam86 wrote a review Aug 2016\n",

      "30 Concepted bed and breakfast accommodation This place very suitable for travelers who concern about cleanliness for an economical place to rest. They provide above average size room with reasonable price. Clean and minimalist bedroom. Access key is only 1 for each room, but they can provide you power card to the room. The hotel surrounding is a bit slump and dark. 100 m from main road.  The bed is quite high from floor. Shower room is quite big. Breakfast is served in a set menu contain : scrambled egg, pineapple, bread and sausage, accompanied by a glass of orange syrup and water.  Overall score for this hotel 7.5/10 Denny Gunawan S wrote a review Jul 2016\n",
      "50 A hidden gem in pattaya The room was beyond amazing for the price I paid. It looked super brand new. I doubt you will get anything better than this for the price u pay in Pattaya... The room and the bathroom was very spacious. And it was sparkling clean. And honestly speaking, the price is such an understatement for the room. Would definitely recommend this for anyone who is visiting Pattaya. Suraaj Nair wrote a review Jun 2016\n",
      "40 Pleasant I found that this hotel was quaint, popular with tourists and cheap. It is situated within walking distance to the beach and shops.

Much activities on the beach for basically anyone. fredbohnen wrote a review May 2016\n",

      "40 A short and sweet visit I went to By Dee for an overnight stay. They were kind enough to allot me a room at the last minute. After a 24h long journey from Sicily, I needed some calm but Pattaya is not a place for it. Having been to Jomtien a few years back, I was aware of this comparatively calm place.  For the price, it is an amazing place. Miss Fern and her colleagues at the reception were ever welcoming and never lost the sweet smile they had to offer!  Being a brand new hotel, the place is nice and clean. It is well maintained. It was just that there was some construction work underway across the hotel and the noise woke us up. Nevertheless, there's hardly anything that the hotel can do anything about it. And we needed to wake up any ways :)  It was a perfect stop over for me after a long journey and before I headed for my kind of a place - Koh Chang, the next day! The hotel staff helped me book a taxi and even let my friend play guitar in the waiting area while we were getting bored waiting for the taxi to arrive, piercing through the weekend Pattaya traffic!  Thank you By Dee and all the best! I shall definitely visit again if I happen to come to Pattaya. My heart goes \"5 stars\" for the review. But it is a new place having a huge potential to become even better and I would love for them to maintain it to get the last star on my next visit! 5 stars next time!! :) PiyushSailor wrote a review Oct 2015\n",
      "50 Lovely new little hotel We stayed at By Dee for two nights and thought it was a really great, value for money place. Its just off the main beach road in Jomtien (so much nicer - in my opinion - than the craziness of Pattaya), and everything is easily accessible by walking and/or songthaew. The staff were so friendly, lovely and helpful, always smiling and super polite. They took us to a place to rent a motorbike, directed us to the night market, and when we realized our water heater was not working, immediately sent the maintenance person to fix it AND upgraded us to one of the rooms on level 7. The hotel is clean and comfortable, minimalist, what we call a 'city hotel' in Indonesia. Two bottles of water and some toiletries are provided, the rooms are spacious and have a fridge, TV and safe, and the AC works well. The wifi is good, and you can get free tea and coffee in the lobby/common area 24/7. We had a fantastic stay and would recommend it to anyone wanting to go to Jomtien. ibupetunia wrote a review Oct 2015\n"

      "50 Hidden treasure in Jomtien beach, 2 thumbs up for this brand new hotel (would give it 5 stars) Can't believe I found this lovely place hiding in Jomtien beach area.  Excellent hotel, with service beyond expectation I received from staffs. My room also was excellent, I stayed on the 7th floor with the best price you could hardly find in Pattaya-Jomtien beach area. I also can drink my fresh coffee right from a high class coffee machine for all day and all night, this was excellent for me who is a coffee addicted before hanging out at night in Pattaya's \"Walking street\".

I arrive at the hotel at 13:00 but I found that the hotel closes. I ring the bell and wait for a long time but nor any officer out. I call the hotel by telephone the staff refused to book a room. Informed that the hotel was no longer available. I have suffered greatly.The hotel is not liable to pay my money. Avoid hotel stays dangerous.

      "40 Will return, Decent Facilities, Reasonably priced, Great Views I would recommend and come back again    The views are amazing and a great location, the staff are decent and try their best, which I appreciated.    Facilities are good, and there are decent options for children with a kid's pool on level 2. Good for couples, or families and reasonably priced.    The suites would be great for hosting a decent sized group to celebrate the new year.    The decor is Thai Traditional and not modern decor, so don't expect that. Some design flaws are clearly stated, but can be overlooked due to the rest of the facilities.    Atmosphere is relaxed and if you don't expect 5 star anything goes, at 5 star prices you'll be satisfied.    Understand the staff enforces hotel policies, so they don't have the leeway to cater to all requests. Expect to pay for additional add-ons which may be clearly stated in your booking policies. M Ng wrote a review Jan 2022\n",
      "50 Wonderful hotel I loved this hotel. room with access to pool. Staff was awesome. Food was very good. Room was very nice. we loved the Asian decor. Kind of far from Pattaya & Baht buses don’t like driving that far. But it’s worth it. I will be back. Connie wrote a review Apr 2019\n",
      "20 Tired and in need of refurbishment A very tired and shabby hotel, in need of renovation. Don’t be deceived by the photos on the website.    Pool area, although on the roof offering good views, was old and required refurbishment.    The bed was uncomfortable, with old sheets and a thin duvet. The pillows were worn out and you needed three instead of one as they were so thin.    The breakfast was poor, with little choice. Very slow replenishment of the buffet-style food and most of it cold.    Restaurant floor dirty, as were the tables.    To sum up: an old, overpriced hotel that needs a full make-over. Fastidious wrote a review Jan 2019\n",
      "10 Very bad Overbooked and didnt have our room available also downgraded us with a cheap room and wouldn't refund any difference. Very bad service and hotel in general would not recommend. Lots of mosquitos ate us alive Adam wrote a review Oct 2017\n",
      "10 Big disappointed I Booked a room there two weeks in advance for the date of 18th of march 2017 by Expedia.com. But The receptionist said there is no room available when we arrived around 3:30 pm at hotel , offered me to come back next day to get a room but waited for 4 hours finally got a room with not a nice view after i have phoned to agent and I have requested to see a manager but no manager in the property and they only give me a email address of manager . of course there was no response when I send email.    Staff are not helpful at all and only insist the guest that to call expedia.com or come back next day. thatpaingoo wrote a review Mar 2017\n",
      "30 Quite a good option. My lovely wife and I stayed here in late March. In general it was a good stay and we would definitely consider staying here again.  The hotel is in a good location, across the road from the beach. It is a reasonably quiet area, however not too far to walk or jump on the baht bus for a bit of nightlife etc  There were issues with wifi for 2 days but eventually sorted.  Our rate included breakfast. To be honest, the breakfast was below par.  Overall it was a good stay. Would recommend hotel to others. Location and value for money. Greg A wrote a review Jun 2016\n",
      "20 Did they give themselves 4 stars? This is not a 4 star hotel or even close to it. At best it would be a 2 1/2 stars. The staff are rude and the fact I am in the land of smiles and yet to see one at the Royal Heritage just about sums it up. Avoid if you can. The rooms have no real amenities like tea or coffee which you would expect from a 4* hotel. We had to call room service back 3 times to clean the bathroom enough for us to go in it.    There is not a single working umbrella in the hotel so you either sit in the boiling hot sun or your room - not a single piece of shade anywhere.    I have stayed in lots of hotels all over Thailand and some of them have been extremely basic but the friendly staff have been a redeeming feature or the clean rooms or excellent breakfast etc.    This hotel does not have a single redeeming feature all the drinks are overpriced the service is poor, the food is poor, the rooms are dirty the pool is dirty (yesterday there were floating cigarette's in the pool) and the debris around the edge of the pool has been there for the last couple of days that we have been here.........    Better options available at better prices so don't bother - looks like they have big tour parties so have completely given up on customer service. Tazza72 wrote a review May 2016\n",
      "10 The worst service ever This was the worst experience in over 20 years travelling to Thailand. Staff is not attentive. Only interested in their mobile Phone and the buss loads of Chinese comming in every day. Tried to deliver laundry, but it would cost 2 days and 10 (!!!) Times the price of the laundry around the corner. When I wanted to speak to the manager about another issue I could only reach him by Email. I wrote an email but of course no reply. ....  Only interested in one time visitors, Will never go back! Huubheide wrote a review Apr 2016\n",
      "30 Ok for the money Just spent 2 weeks here and after the lack of reviews on here and worrying reviews on agodo really felt we had booked a really poor hotel.  We arrived around 9 pm and were met with chaos on reception and a few cats so didn't start well. We then had to pay 1000 bhat to cover the mini bar. We then were given wifi codes and advised breakfast vouchers would be issued, we did not book breakfast so this was a bonus.    We got to the room and the key didn't work.it's a contactless card type so had to get it reprogrammed we were told a additional key would have an extra charge so didn't bother,the room was of a good size on the 9th floor with secluded balcony and sea view. The room could have done with more storage and hangers but was ok. The bathroom was nice size but could have had a deep clean around the shower edges where it was quite mouldy. The shower itself was brilliant though really powerful and hot. The air con in the room was also excellent.  As the first day passed and we got to find our bearings we really liked the hotel position just across the road from the beach and close to local restaurant and shops.. The 10bhat bus was easy to use as well although the didn't alllways go up as far up as the hotel so sometimes had to walk some of the way back but not a problem.    At times I think we were the only guests in the hotel and at weekends it was packed mainly with Asian tourists .  The pools were nice but started to go green on 2nd week so we didn't use them. Also the gym was closed but we never wanted to use that. A bar would have been nice but there are many close by.    Overall the hotel is fine but the beds were quite hard, the rooms were however cleaned daily and 2 bottles of water delivered each day Which was nice.    I would not rate it as a 4 star but for the price we paid was more than acceptable. Although we had breakfast vouchers we never used them as always got up too late and missed it.    As we checked our in the early hours the 1000 bhat was returned as we didn't use the mini bar. The security guard though was fast asleep as we left so waste of time him being on duty    Ideal as a base and if you get a good deal worth booking this hotel but it's not a high service hotel. davjav wrote a review Mar 2016\n",
      "30 The staff in the restaurant needed to get their cloths washed, they all looked dirty. We have stayed here a few times, but not since they built the extension. And found this Hotel very nice. But since they have done the extension, the only fault I could find was the staff, once away from the check in desk, all needed to smarten up, the cloths they wore looked very dirty. This was a real put off. Stewartanderson wrote a review Jan 2016\n"

      "30 Stylist swimming pool & rooftop bar may worth to visit here Highlights for this hotel are Swimming pool & rooftop bar for instagram photos. For Thais or foreigners who expect the beach, Sun bathing or poolside relaxation, you may not get it. Pay higher price to get front building with sea view & in room bath tubs. Standard room may not be stylist as expected.  Staffs are ok in general but for weekend, please don’t expect attentive or fast service.    โรงแรมแบบโมเดิร์นในเครือวิรันดาที่หลายคนอาจจะตั้งใจมาพักเป็นหนึ่งในลิสต์ โดยส่วนตัวถือว่าการมาพักในความพอใจระดับปานกลางและอาจจะผิดหวังในบางจุด  จุดเด่นคือ  1. สระน้ำที่สวยในเชิงการว่ายน้ำ และถ่ายรูป มาเป็นอันดับหนึ่งแต่ถ้าวันเสาร์ อาจจะต้องเผชิญฝูงมหาชน    2. ดาดฟ้า และมุม roof top สวยน่าถ่ายรูป แต่อาจจะเผชิญปัญหาคนเช่นกัน และร้านอาหารจำเป็นมากที่จะต้องจองล่วงหน้า    สำหรับเรื่องอื่นๆน่าจะพิจารณาเช่น  1. คิวการ checkin & out ยาวมาก ใช้เวลาเยอะเพราะ คนมาใช้สิทธิกันเยอะ พอสมควร พนักงานพยายามจัดการ ดูแลด้วยเครื่องดื่มแต่ อาจจะยังไม่ได้ผล  2. หากจอดรถไกล หรือในวันคนเยอะ การดูแลรับส่งกระเป๋าอาจจะช้า หรือ ผิดพลาด  3. ห้องอาหารเช้า คนเยอะในวันหยุด และมีการจัดเป็นรอบๆ จำเป็นต้องเลือก  4. ห้องพัก แนะนำเป็นห้องราคาสูงด้านหน้าวิวทะเล  หากไม่ได้ ซีเรียส ห้องพักธรรมดาก็ปานกลาง การตกแต่งอาจจะไม่เทียบเท่ากับความเป็นวิรันดา FoodTraveler_Huangshuzhen wrote a review Apr 2022\n",

      "50 Water story in Pattaya The Veranda Resort Pattaya Na Jomtien is, according to my tastes, located in the best possible place in the area, far from the teeming beach of Pattaya, which I don't like.    The architecture of the hotel is resolutely avant-garde and magnificent.    The water in general and the swimming pool, in particular, dictated the design of the building.    Water is omnipresent in the resort, even on the roof terrace of the hotel, where the restaurant tables are islands imprisoned in a vast basin.    The rooms are spacious, comfortable, modern and flooded with light from floor-to-ceiling windows covering the entire facade of the building.    I must also highlight the friendliness of the staff, the general quality of the service and the catering. Alyxo wrote a review Mar 2022\n",

      "50 Fabulous little oasis in Pattaya From when we checked in to when we checked out it was excellent customer service at a resort with fabulous amenities - large pool perfect for lounging right by the sea which was clean and well-kept, clean, modern and spacious rooms (we had the seascape ocean view room) with great showers and top notch toiletries, a well stocked buffet breakfast that had a good enough selection for all (my husband is vegan so it’s sometimes difficult for him at breakfast buffets) and it was clean and kept fresh. We would like to highlight that the sunset view from this resort is gorgeous and perfect with a cocktail in hand. We definitely give props to the barman as his cocktails were AMAZING. He sure knows how to make margaritas, Negronis and a darn good Bloody Mary . It wasn’t fancy fancy, but it was modern, sleek, clean, and they took care of the little touches with good customer service throughout the whole visit. A lovely little oasis in Pattaya . We will definitely be back! Foodobsessive72 wrote a review Feb 2022\n",
      "40 Super crowded. Maybe I picked the wrong time of year. My partner and I booked the place in summer 2020 and loved it! So we returned with friends this time.    Not as good as our last visit. The place is PACKED! I mean really packed, probably fully booked. It took about 20mins to check-in. But it’s understandable though. People are excited to trravel again after months of lockdown. Plus, the travel together campaign. And it’s only about an hour from Bangkok.    The breakfast buffet had to be split into three rounds due to the numbers of people. It was as diverse as always. Staffs were hospitable as expected.    But the pool, the POOL, in the evening was swamped by people. I mean yes, it’s a hotel pool. What do you expect? Family with kids in the water. Couple tried to get the best angle for their social media. What a sight.    Anyways, I still like the place. But next time maybe I’ll try weekday instead. chutchutchut wrote a review Jan 2022\n",

The service was outstanding from the very beginning to the very end. Reslimpan wrote a review Dec 2021\n",
      "40 Instagrammable hotel. Pricy but worth if you want good photos for your social media. During check in, there were many guests waiting for checked in. It was fast and well managed.  Bed was large and comfortable. Good quality of the bathroom amenities.  Nice white and blue colored pool.  Breakfast was ok but could be better. Signature seafood omelet was not really a signature one. Sorry to say this but it is very simple with a few seafood in it.  Love their fast and stable WiFi.  It is a beachfront hotel but the beach was not nice during my stay.    My tip if you want to take photo with the pool. You should do it after check in time or in the morning because the pool is very famous for Thais and it is instagramable. Prepare your dress or swimming outfit that looks good with white and blue color. Samboonyalertroj wrote a review Oct 2021\n"

I got all the benefit I deserve from her.    The alacarte on G floor restaurant is quite delicious. Whether the simple menu like fried noodles or wakyu hamburger. I can feel lots of different on the taste. Cant explain by words.    Our dinner in the hotel also superb. I haven't got this impressive experience before. The seafood set at the beach is very good. The food and the location of the dining table is much over expectation than what I see from the brochure. Mr.Kaek and Mr.X always look after us all the time with smile. We had a lot conversation to them and it is really good.    The breakfast, the welcome drink, the hitea are all lovely. I really love them all.    Before depart; I’ve got a puncture. Lucky me, your bellboys saw it and let me know before I left. Then Hotel technician came to change tire for us. The event is at 4pm on October 10. Please find this two bellboys and give them praise on my behalf.    I will stay in your hotel again in very near future. :) Thawat-Ko wrote a review Oct 2021\n",

      "30 Beautiful Resort! Although we have been to Pattaya many times, but it was our first time at this beautiful seaside resort. It’s got everything one would normally expect - great location, polite staff, spectacular sunsets to admire, and much more.    But our stay was defined by two gracious ladies we met and who looked after us throughout our stay. Khun Joobjang was there to welcome us at check in, and escorted us to our room. Thereafter, she was there to help and guide us anytime we needed in a most professional manner. We also met Khun Dady at the Waves Bar, who was most attentive and pleasant as possible.    Hotels and resorts can have the best location but without dedicated people like Khun Joobjang and Khun Dady, they would lack character. Our sincere thanks to these two ladies!    I have one suggestion for the hotel. While it is always difficult to confront guests, but hotels need to do that in order to protect their other guests.    This resort has absolutely no discipline at the swimming pool. There are no signs requiring guests to take a shower before jumping in. And, we watched 99% of the guests just jump in without this basic courtesy to other guests.    But, even worse, I have never seen a supposedly 5 star hotel which allows guests with their normal day clothes to just jump into the pool, with no swim suit requirements. And, we saw scores of guests with shorts, tee shirts, pants, just jumping into the pool.    Is it a swimming pool or a community bath tub to clean yourself? I find it hard to believe that an international chain like Accor will permit this inconsiderate behavior. Surely, these guests need to learn basic etiquettes and Accor is not helping by accepting this behavior.    Needless to say, we stayed away from this ‘community bathtub’ given what we saw. We mentioned this issue to hotel staff but apparently they are powerless. Management support is needed to drive this behavior change of certain guests.    Hopefully we can enjoy the swimming pool along with the profession courtesy of staff such as Khun Joobjang and Khun Dady on our next visit. Bluecann wrote a review Dec 2020\n",

Check in was smooth and I was very impressed that the room was ready. The hotel is beautiful and the facilities are up to the standard. The breakfast is very limited and not many choices. No egg Benedict at egg station. I have only one concern regarding security that the hotel’s elevator does not require key card so simply anyone can get in the elevator and press wherever they want to go.

      "50 10 out of 10 Pattaya is an excellent holiday destination during COVID-19 for people living in Bangkok. Only 90-min drive from the capital.    We went there on weekday, so the hotel was not too busy. Hotel staffs are very helpful and friendly. Hotel decor gives a very relaxing vibe. The view of the swimming pool is superb.    The breakfast buffet is great too. Many choices to choose from. Tasty too.    We stayed in an Ocean Front. The room was really clean. And Oh, don’t forget about the bed. There was this 8FEET bed right in the middle of the room. You can’t complain about that. The aircon was quiet. It was one of my best night sleep in quite a while.    Recommended for couple, family, or even friends. We, in fact, considered revisiting Veranda soon. So yeah, 10 out of 10. chutchutchut wrote a review Aug 2020\n",
      "30 Not worth the price for ocean front room type. I had a very nice sea view from my ocean front room but for 7000-8000 THB per night with small size room on low season it looks quite pricey for my opinion.    With this price you can go many others hotel that they can provide you a pool villa or Suite room.    Breakfast not good enough.    Btw all staffs are very helpful.

      "30 MY FIRST STAY DURING NEW NORMAL do not recommend to stay during long public holidays when all rooms are 100% fully booked, it means super crowded! the resort itself plus the residence side are using the limited facilities like swimming pool and all dining. The breakfast each day with 3 rounds to serve are fully packed . The beach side or pool side to sit are not enough for all guests . We were in our swimming attires but have to go back to our rooms as the pool or beach area couldn't accommodate more people to use. However, I wld say all staff are really good they all are service mind , the Thai manager too sorry I cldn't see his name. The food and drinks for dinner using ACCOR member privilege were so good.

      "10 only for families- Warning We was attracted by nice photographies from beautiful swimming pool and quiet atmosphere but the first thing the staff told us is... so sorry you can not book dinner it is full of families with kids and for breakfast it will be very complicated because of kids... basically yes it was impossible to enjoy the swimming pool or anything except to stay at the room. They should advise 5is is an hotel for kids and families. The only free time to swim or relax is after2 pm to 4 pm when they are eating and sleeping after that you should find the way to escape as soon as you can... but there is no transportation from the hotel so try to find some grab taxi who can pick you.  Avoid 100% the breakfast it is only junk food and very poor quality.  The quality of rooms is ok ... the bed are really strong and you will feel it in the early morning.  The staff does not speak english so probably they are more focus on the high quantity of thia nationals renting the back building residence for families. stephaneracine wrote a review Jun 2020\n",

      "10 A Shame of Mgallery managed by Sofitel We booked a 2 night family vacation in this hotel. We arrived at the hotel around 19:00 - 20:00 hrs by car. It was not our first time for us, if i could recall it was the second time. We accommodated our baby 1/5 YO.    It was an exhausting trip driving from bangkok. At the hotel lobby where normally a bellman/concierge staff standing by for luggage assistance were not there. So we arranged the trolley by ourselves but struggled with it because we needed to push the trolley along the bumpy walkway to the lobby, while doing that the lady staff suddenly came and asked us with a bad tone of voice that \"what are you doing!?\" Then she took the trolley for us to the lobby instead. The receptionist well acknowledged (trust me) the whole situation that we were in well enough and we wish they should had realized to recover the situation and make thing more at ease but the lady receptionist who was in charge of checking us in, kept asking for \"loyalty card\" and I am 100% sure that you have the whole profile and record in the accor database - I need to ran back to the car and get my phone and just to show her my electronic loyalty card? The receptionist promised us at check in that there will be \"a tea set\" to be served at our convenient time which we proposed on Saturday 14, 16:00hrs - it has never come and the worst is they do not realize it. The room service is what we have for during the trip lunch or dinner and the wait time was approx 30 mins but the dinner on Saturday 14, we ordered 1 dish (Breaded Fish) just wish to share it with my baby. We ordered at 20:00 hrs and when it took 1.40hrs to arrive my baby was already asleep and missed his dinner. When I follow up my food with reception she took the issue and said will be follow up but never call back to us and keep us in posted - I need to call back just to remind my concerns \"the gentleman reception\" took the matter very professional at least for once he follow up with room service for us and get them to call us back roughly 10 mins after. The room service lady asked me that \"can you please reconfirm your order?'' Why do I need to reconfirm my order!?!? Obviously they DID NOT TOOK my order last hours ago that I had been waiting? The food came by at the room with 2 free drinks as a sorry gesture? At the rooftop bar, we wanted to have the welcome drinks, we were told that the restaurant is full with the corporate event so we asked to be placed up on the roof and it was fine with them. We asked to have 2 draft beers. However, the staff said the government order is not allowed to serve any alcohol drink in the hotel and then behind us is the bar line up with draft beer for the corporate group but not for us. Then we pointed out to the staff that what is happening here you just said something to me and did it differently to the other?! this is unbelievable!. It shows inequality standard from Accorhotels.    I am a platinum member - It is explicitly  bad while for me because I have been traveling and staying in many Accorhotels, I have never felt so much ignored as staying here. This experience we have been through could be easily recovered if the hotel management trained the staff to think beyond, be alert and prompt to the problems. I can not ignore this matter and the one who is responsible is the management levels. The hotel is a perfect match for our family's trip destination since it is not so far from bangkok and it is less stressful to travel by car with our little son. However, there are many more Accorhotels alternatives which give a similar or even better environment plus a greater service quality as well. and I do not think when the hotel is fully packed is the reason to disregard this matter.    I totally regret the experience in this hotel. J Raspiengeas wrote a review Jun 2020\n"

Other facilities are good, particularly a swimming pool, but there were a few cabanas and pool seating areas, as hotel guesses had to share with Veranda residence guesses.

      "40 Serenity in Pattaya We booked this hotel knowing very little about it and we were pleasantly surprised by how relaxing and serene the hotel is despite being just outside the seedy Pattaya.    The staff was friendly and the Sky sunset dinner totally blew us away.    The walking seafood street is also 5 minutes away on foot.    The only downside is that there wasn’t much to do for kids if you were to stay there for many days. Nonetheless, we prefer it to those hustle and bustle in Pattaya city centre. We will definitely come back. noocroft wrote a review Jan 2020\n",
      "50 Relaxing, hardly believed we were in Pattaya it was a nice and quiet relaxing holiday for us by the beach in nice environment. We could not believe we were in Pattaya .. admittedly it's just outside Pattaya city centre.. but this is great and it's only 1:30 hr drive from Bangkok. I'd highly recommend this resort to those (esp families) who want some quiet time by the beach near Bangkok. Yu A wrote a review Jan 2020\n",

We got an upgraded room because of an Accor Card , which was a real bonus. The pool is right next to the beach, the bar served great drinks and the restaurant served excellent Thai and Western food. Certainly worth the trip. Thanks. Carl G wrote a review Nov 2019\n",
      "10 Worst hotel ever I stayed in this hotel for 2night.  Facilities suppose to separate for residences and resorts. There are many people which have very bad manners. Residence people just came to pool and took photo. Some of them are noisy.    For housekeeper, 1st night is no shampoo and conditioner. Towels are kept and there is no new towel for 2nd night.    The worst thing is kid club. There is no assistant in club. Some kid threw thing to us and their family said a bad words and there is no sorry words from them.    PS. THIS SHOULD BE A ZERO STAR FROM THIS HOTEL. NO MANGEMENT AND NEVER SEE A MANAGER IN THIS HOTEL. FORUZZ wrote a review Oct 2019\n",
      "20 Bad resort service. Not worth the 5-star service price. Bad resort service. Not worth the 5-star service price. Staff said if you check out the resort will not help you anything. They have a van service at 17:30 PM but if you check out at 12PM they will not let you use the van service to the center so if you are on your own you can drag your luggage on foot to the big road and pick up Car to the city center. A seedy resort access to the resort is difficult for a self-planned tour, just suitable for guided tours. The road is not covered with dust, many wild dogs, dark and empty, very dangerous for women and children    나쁜 리조트 서비스. 5 성급 서비스 가격은 가치가 없습니다. 직원들은 리조트를 체크 아웃하면 아무것도 도움이되지 않을 것이라고 말했다. 그들은 오후 17:30에 밴 서비스를 제공하지만 오후 12시에 체크 아웃하면 밴 서비스를 센터로 사용할 수 없으므로 혼자서 짐을 싣고 큰 도로로 짐을 끌 수 있습니다. 시내 중심에 차. 리조트에 대한 초보 리조트 액세스는 자체 계획 여행이 어렵고 가이드 투어에 적합합니다. 도로는 먼지, 많은 야생 개, 어둡고 비어 있으며 여성과 어린이에게 매우 위험합니다.    糟糕的度假服务。不值得5星级的服务价格。工作人员说，如果您退房，度假村将无济于事。他们在17:30 PM提供面包车服务，但是如果您在12PM退房，他们将不允许您使用面包车服务到中心，因此，如果您是一个人，则可以将行李步行拖到大路上并提货开车到市中心。自行计划的游览很难到达度假胜地的茂密度假胜地，仅适合带导游的旅行。道路上没有灰尘，许多野狗，黑暗而空旷，对妇女和儿童非常危险 AMBER KEITH wrote a review Oct 2019\n",

      "50 Highly recommend I have just returned after a fantastic week staying in the Veranda resort. Myself and my little boy stayed in the resident apartment for 4 nights and my husband joined us in a family room for the final night.  The rooms were very well kept, and had everything you would need for a very relaxing break. They were cleaned daily and stocked with water.  The family room was excellent, with a private pool (small) on the balcony, a huge living area and a separate area for my son. The family room was expensive, hence why we only stayed there when my husband returned. However, it was a lovely treat!  The pool area was fantastic (we actually used the back pool with the slide, as well as the big pool overlooking the beach) again well maintained with a really impressive view over the ocean. Even though it was busy, we still managed to get a lovely big sun lounger.  Used the gym, which was small but absolutely fine for a holiday work out!  The food was good for breakfast, and we enjoyed two meals in the restaurant in the evening. Service was good and prices reasonable. (if you have a Accorplus card, the price is reduced further)  My son felt like a little celebrity, the staff were very attentive and always stopped for a chat. On one of the days he had been bitten on his foot, and the staff on the desk helped provide cream (and distraction!)  We only live in Bangkok, so will definitely be back. In my opinion, its the best we have seen in Pattaya.  A special thanks for Simon for helping with all out bags (and boxes of my sons toys for the room) and Sunny, the very friendly waiter!

      "50 Best memories The title says it all. This hotel is now a part of my wonderful latest memories my family and I have together created. It gives us the break that our family needed, for both parents and child. The hotel itself is very spacious and airry, especially for city people like us who live in Bangkok, we feel like we can breathe here and relax, our child can run freely, play in the sand or swim in the pool. One of the best things is that you don’t feel like you’re in Pattaya at all, the hotel is located right next to the beach where it is quiet and peaceful. Last but not least is how friendly staff here are! We received a very warm welcome from the lady staff named “Pla”, we were impressed by how detailed she was while answering our questions regarding the Accor Plus member’s benefits, she is obviously the asset of the hotel and very professional.

      "40 Spacious rooms with balcony. Come here for the pool not the beach. Nice weekend getaway Located about a 15mins drive from Pattaya city. It is located just off the main highway which made it easy to get to some major tourist attractions like the Outlet Mall, Tiger and elephant park and popular beach restaurants like the Glass House & Cafe del Mar.    Rooms are nicely designed and are spacious with a huge bed that can fit 2 adults and 2 young children. Our room had a balcony with a slight view of the sea.    Breakfast starts early at 6am on weekdays which was perfect for us. Good selection of asian and western food.    The pool area is beautifully designed with a few cabanas along the side. There are also jacuzzis in the pool.    The roof deck has a perfect view of the pool and sea. Great for sunset and photos.    Please take note that the beach at Veranda is not ideal. It’s quite dirty with visible rubbish on the sand. Come here to just relax and enjoy the pool instead, it’s perfect!    Right next to Veranda is the Skoop beach bar which is also part of the hotel so you can sign food and drinks to your room. They serve good burgers, waffles and ice cream.    The only issue we had with the rooms, was that the cable tv was unstable and the channels we could watch were in Thai. The soap dispensers in the shower, I didn’t find very practical. The spout is too tiny which couldn’t dispense much soap. There is also no soap dish at the sink so we had to use a towel to place the bar of soap.    Otherwise, an enjoyable stay, excellent Thai service MTL66 wrote a review Apr 2019\n",

      "50 Relaxation Had a few days off between business meetings so decided to use the TripAdvisor website to find a place to stay.  TripAdvisor had many choices of booking sites. Amoma.com had the best price for the Veranda Resort for $400 less than any other site for the same period!!  I thought this can’t be right, too good to be true. I booked it anyway.  What I got was an excellent large room, balcony overlooking the sea. Breakfast was included, so much variety on offer. Three restaurants at the resort to choose from. All I had to do was eat and relax.  Big thumbs up to TripAdvisor for having the best choices of booking sites. Another thumbs up to Amoma.com for having the best deal and Veranda Resort for a very comfortable, luxurious, relaxing stay. Joe R wrote a review Feb 2019\n",

      "50 Had a fantastic stay here. Strongly recommend. We came to Pattaya for a week to avoid the air pollution in Bangkok. Found this place by chance and booked directly with the hotel website. We got a really great deal for 4 nights including BF. We stayed in the Residence (high rise bldg), not the resort bldg hence the price is much less yet we get to use the same facilities as hotel guests.  Plus 1) Breakfast. Very good selection. We were so lucky BF is included as we overheard it would cost 680THB (£15) per head if lay separately.  2) Kid play area. We use this play area every morning for our 20 mths toddler to run wild! There was no one else using it.  3) space. We are in a one-bedroom apartment hence space in the living room and TV for us to watch while our daughter sleeps in the bedroom.  4) swimming pool. Beautifully set out and clean.  5) There is a small convenient store next to the property.  6) Staff are always helpful and friendly.  7) The most comfortable bed we ever found in a hotel!!!  For completeness of info, there are some slight downsides (only me being extra picky here):  1) No travel cot provided - but no problem for us as we brought our own.  2) No changing facility in the lobby area & near the swimming pool - again not a big deal as we bought our daughter back to change in our room.  3) The path to the swimming pool/ restaurant/ beach has slope but with steps. Again, not too bad as my husband can maneuver the buggy very well.    All in all we love our stay here and will come back when we are in Thailand next year. And surely will recommend to friends and family. May P wrote a review Jan 2019\n",

      "40 Good Hotel but restaurant is not up to standard I stayed one night there, booked 4 rooms for my family. Arrived around 130pm but only 2 rooms is ready but 2pm. Maybe it is Christmas season. The upgraded me as i am Accor Gold for one room. The room is good. Mine has a bath tub inside middle of the room. I cant really see the sea though.    That night we decided to have dinner at the restaurant as the nearest restaurant is 1.2km away. There is not many people at the restaurant even the hotel is fully booked. I can understand why, service is quite slow (15 mins) but hygiene is a problem. there are smell along some corridor and flies everywhere and nothing is done to it ?    Simple dinner but quite costly even i get 20% off the bill. I dont think it is worth the value.    There is a Family mart just outside the hotel and you can get tut tut to go to the restaurant nearby.    It is a good getaway place with hanging sofa to the sea. Pool is great.

      "40 Great location The staff was friendly and professional (but not enough of them at check-in and check-out). The room was on the small side, but very clean and restful with a great balcony and a large bathroom. However, the bathroom didn't have a separate door for the commode rendering the large bathroom useless if someone needed to use the commode. Dinner was esquisite with a great view, tasty, well presented items and a efficient staff. Breakfast buffet was a let down. While there was a variety of items, most were cold or at least on the less than desirable temperature I prefer to eat, especially the eggs. The eggs were so cold they were inedible and I had to special order in order to get hot eggs - which the chef graciously accomadated my request. In the future, we will stay at a different Accor brand hotel most likely. The6Carrikers wrote a review Jan 2019\n",

Great recommendation from the Front desk staff, to eat at the hotel and also in a sea food restaurant near by.    Although, there are a few points for improvement, as many furniture and decoration are small damaged.    Also the fact of having many constructions and in particular the one beside the swimming pool, makes the stay less comfortable.    Even the hotel is correct on the price range in the area for a 5* hotel, I found it overpriced reading its competitors. Daniel R wrote a review Dec 2018\n",

The only downfall is the extra charges, breakfast is 650 baht pp per day, shuttle into the city isn't free like most hotels, costing 100 baht pp and one way only. As many others said it is a far distance from Pattaya and the taxi home is a minimum 300 baht. this all starts to add up on top of a luxury price hotel.    Still, this is the only downfall of the resort and its views, pool and rooms are well above standard. Hannahbanana wrote a review Dec 2018\n",

Do not believe any promise or response that the staff said. They promised to solve the cancellation problem but they have not replied to me since last May and now they ignore my email.    I tried to book this hotel for 1 night using my accor point in Jan,2018. During the reservation process, there was a technical error, so I booked two rooms on same date(separate reservation). I called to front desk immediately if I cancel one of reservation without cancellation penalty as the booking was made in wrong way due to the technical error on Accor app.    The staff answered to me that two bookings were made at almost same time so they would allow me to cancel without cancellation penalty.    When I was checking in, I found that the points that I spent was not back to my account. So, I have asked the front desk staff to check it again and she said that it might take few more days to fix it.    I believed what front desk staff was saying but they did not fix it. I have been waiting more than 3months, but I did not get any feedback from hotel. I have sent email to hotel in May again. They replied to me \"sorry for late response\" and they promised to fix it as soon as possible. I have waited one more month but I did not get any feedback again. I have sent email to Hotel again in June. I have received email from Hotel and they said that the hotel staff who was dealing of my matter has resigned so they were unable to fix my matter. They said that \"we are very sorry\" again but I did not get any feedback from them after that time.    I have sent email again to hotel one month later and they ignored my email again.    This is very long journey since January. The points are not big but I am really disappointed in the way of dealing with customer problem and kept lying to customer with smile and apology.    Do not believe the hotel's statement and reply, please record all their answers and get the signed confirmation letter from them.    I think this hotel does not have any manager and proper monitoring system and they do not deserve the Acoor brand name. david h wrote a review Sep 2018\n"

      "40 Real beachfront hotel, relaxing weekend :-) Pros;  1. Beautiful hotel (Gorgeous pool and beachfront seating area);  2. Quiet and relaxing because it's a bit out of town (suitable for couple);  3. Dont forget to watch the sunset...... so pretty  3. We stayed at the residence so you can use both facilities of hotel and residence (The room has it own kitchen which is very nice)    Cons;  1. you kindda need a car to get around, nothing is walking distance unless you just stay in the hotel Tum Tantayopin wrote a review Aug 2018\n",

      "30 A pleasan and windy beach hotel A peasant hotel location to the south of Pattaya with a nice beach, good pool and a refreshing windy sea breeze at the end of rather a bumpy and exciting drive from the Sukhuwmit Road, take care of your car suspension in the last few hundred metres! A laissez fair attitude from the staff, so expect to follow up regularly for everything twice, but keep smiling, keep asking and you'll be fine. 200984 wrote a review Aug 2018\n",

      "40 Anniversary dinner and stay. Easy to get to, good parking, nice atmosphere in the lobby, Staff were very helpful. Checked in at about 1.30, the room was ready which was nice, no waiting. Room was very comfortable with a small private swimming pool,(dip). We had booked the roof top restaurant but rain stopped us, so the next floor down dinning room and veranda was where we had dinner. Quite good although some of the items on the menu and the wine menu were not available. Breakfast was a full international spread, very good, nice dinning experience by the water fall that flows from the large swimming pall down to the dinning level. Hotel is direct on the beach.

      "20 Good facilities - Horrible service I liked the overall look of the hotel. Unfortunately the staffs don’t manage to keep up with the service.    Check in was empty on arrival but still they managed to keep us standing at the check in desk for 15 minutes. Also extremely poor service from the staff to chance the service language to Thai after they realized my girlfriend was thai. No information given about breakfast times and such.    Room was clean and in decent condition, little bit worn out here and there. Information booklet was broken and the information leaflets were in wrong order, there was duplicates of some pages and some information was completely missing(breakfast times for example). I was surprised by the lack of quality in beddings. I wasn’t expecting Sofitel quality but still wished for something bit better.    I also find it offending that the hotel is posting stickers to items in room to tell you that you have to pay if you take them with you.    Pool area is nice but the staff managed to ruin the experience again. Up on entering the pools there was no one to be found to get the towels. I finally managed to find the place where they store towels and helped my self with them. Couple minutes later a member of staff came to me threatening that next time I have to pay 1000 baht for the towels. Weird since they are there for the guests to use and specially when there is no one around to hand them over.    I’m not sure if they actually serve food and drinks to the sun beds. There was no one around so we went to the bar to order lunch. Food was ok yet pricey as expected.    Location wise the hotel is in extremely bad location. Basically only option is to use taxi to get around or walk few hundred meters to catch the songthaew to the city. Maybe the bad location is not a problem for someone who just likes to spend time at the hotel.    Overall decent hotel with good facilities but horrible level of service. Sad that I have to experience this in Accor group hotels. hoop87 wrote a review Aug 2018\n",
      "40 Impressive Infinity Swimming Pool According to Accor members suggestion, I have very high expected to Veranda Resort Pattaya. However, The overall is below expectation. I had to wait very long queue for check-in, unprofessional staffs, upgraded the same room type but partial ocean view, limited use of Accor Plus coupon which I can use many as I want at other AccorHotels.    Sea breeze ocean view room is average, clean as standard. I do not like the idea of showing the price or price tag for most of in-room amenities. DND tag is very unacceptable for luxury resort. It seems like just piece of rubbish paper.    Only touched facility was the infinity salt water pool. Incredible great! I enjoyed the pool most of time because the room itself was not interesting enough. Should provide resort for a day pass instead of accommodation.    Location is quite far from Pattaya city around 30 minutes drive or more due to traffic.    Thanks to your welcome. Camellia W wrote a review Aug 2018\n",
      "20 Not recommended if long stay. We stayed in Sky Villa for 3 nights and Family villa for 3 nights. Veranda pattaya has unique design which is good for taking pictures. Good for 1-2 nights night. Nothing much in the resort.    My son had an accident due to slippery floor in the villa. We paid all the expenses in the hospital and left my son's head a scar forever.    On the time we stayed December 2017. There was so much noise due to construction in the neighborhood not in Veranda. Which made our vacation not a pleasant vacation for 6 nights.    Sorry but not coming back. Jenny J's Travel wrote a review Jul 2018\n",
      "40 Great pool, comfortable room We had a nice stay at Veranda resort Pattaya. Good location, close walk to the nearby seafood restaurants and convenient stores. We stayed in July for 3 nights. The arrival date was my husband’s birthday and we received a lovely treat in our room :) thank you.  The ocean view room is very nice, with nice pool view and ocean view.  The pool is nicely designed. Very beautiful and relaxing. The landscape design and the detail of the building made the hotel quite unique. The staffs are friendly. We just hope the hotel would be more eco- friendly(the beach cafe and hotel cafe use plastic cups, straws, utensils). The hotel use plastic bottles etc.    Pattaya beach is flooded with trash, but the hotel staffs keep the hotel beach clean. Please pay more attention to the material used in the hotel to help keep the nature cleaner. With small effort, you would drag more customers to your hotel, and we could save our nature :)    The place is a must visit for a couple or family with children who want to visit Pattaya!

      "20 unfavorable service Front Door & Reception : without good manner to provide client how to check in or drop the luggage.  Room Service : spacious room, but there are many marks to inform client that you have to pay if you take it home, obviously a big sign put on every single thing in the room. Personally never seen thing like this before.  Breakfast : few choice of breakfast and hotel staff did not ask tea or coffee, have to go to tea & coffee station making it on my own, overall the hotel staffs are not professional.  Swimming pool: this is the best thing in Veranda, good design, very clean and well maintained. Keeping all this good work. Thiwakorn L wrote a review Jul 2018\n"

      "40 A Pleasant Stay at Veranda Resort Pattaya MGallery by Sofitel My Stay Plus night for 2017 was not used last year but Accor Plus was kind enough to keep it until 30th June 2018. We decided to try booking a room at Veranda Resort Pattaya as it is outside the Pattaya Center. The place is not easy to find  with a map from Google. Getting to Na Jomtien 4 was already a challenge, finding the resort was even more challenging. We drove past Veranda Residence as there is not  any sign to indicate that the resort is in the same area as the residence. To get to the lobby which is one floor down, we had to use the stair or a lift which is not guest friendly as it is not intended to be used by guests. For people over seventy, these are all new experiences.  The friendly staff and the room quality over compensates the above drawbacks. We were fascinated by the design, the space and the cleanliness of the room. The surrounding was excellent with adequate private beach although some refuse can be seen on the beach. The beach can be further improved by regular  ridding of the refuse.The breakfast at the Deck is of high quality taking into consideration the price.  Overall, the resort is an excellent place to stay. Surachai N wrote a review Jun 2018\n",
      "30 Fringing on edges of Overrated Veranda, one of those highly acclaimed among the Thais I heard so much about. They have hotels throughout the kingdom such as Hua Hin and Chiangmai. Must be good I thought, all them pictures looks so wonderful. Well then, to Pattaya it is, a night of stay.    Veranda in Pattaya is actually kind of a half hotel and half condominium, with the block up front nearer the beach being ran as a hotel. If you are expecting a good wide horizon view of the sea, like me, you will be utterly disappointed unless you burn huge holes in pocket for ocean front units. I have picked to stay in the Family Pool Suite with its own private pool, something pricy. Pricy… shouldn’t go wrong. Well then, I was treated to a very exciting and close view of silver minivans along the parking lot accompanied by a backdrop of 2 cranes that went about doing their own business. The drivers of the vans loitering below were also treated to the view of me splashing about in the pool like a beached whale struggling to reach deeper open water. I won’t call it a pool, it was small. Since privacy is actually to be called transparency in the unit I stayed, so low to the ground floor, we cocooned ourselves in 95% of the time. Fortunately, room is huge, separated bedroom with its own TV, living room, 2 bunk beds that can sleep 2 children, a large table I can happily work.    Veranda is built on those typical rectangular plots of land. This is the way of Thailand. Therefore, any worthy real estate is limited to that short breadth along its edges which could account for less than 20% of the perimeter. And that’s where all the advertise pictures were taken.    Now disappointment number 2 was, have you ever seen a floating pool of ants that had drowned in that cup of sugary water you accidentally left out overnight? That was how crowded the pool is while I was there. Add the residence from behind to the equation of weekend guest, seclusion and serenity evaporates. And it was the same for breakfast, it was too crowded and people had to wait. But I have to praise the stuffs that catered to the morning crowd. The buffet spread was never empty and when some were, it was quickly refilled. My palate was only slightly tickled by their breakfast, it was average. And I had to apply150nm of torque to turn the pepper grinder and nothing came out. So, I ate my sunny side up plain.    There is actually a lovely coffee shack to the left the hotel on the shoreline. It is situated on sandy grounds and the best food I had was there. Crafted burgers, so greasy, juicy and messy when eaten. The burst of beefiness explodes in every bite of that layered sin. The buns they heated, added that fluffiness and the sacred umami of the grill. Mouthwatering just thinking about it. But, expect a crowd. Unless, it’s really one of those boring working weekdays. I did go for a second time for burger there a week or so after my stay. It was during the course of work and I detoured to have lunch. And I really enjoyed my burger in peace with the sea breeze.

      "20 Terrible hotel If you need a privacy for relaxing, this place is not choice. The common area in this properites must share for hotels guests and residential.  Re    Refer to Accor's benefit; the hotel should provide the special lane for check in , check out for accor's memvber. At this place, they doesnot provide it. And the worse case is number of staffs for checkin is not enough. All guests is waiting for check in process in over 30 minutes.    Hotel facilities i.e. restaurant. In the weekend the no.of guests (hotel,resident) and out-side guest(for dining only) come to sea sky restaurant many more so more than the number of seats of the restaurant. The staff informed that the restaurant had already fully booked in this evening, we cannot find the seat for us.( I went to Sea Sky Restaurant on 4 P.M. , the staff skill is poor to manage the service. So I came to my room then call the pizza to delivery for my dining.    Securities is lower the standard; the hotel is the newest hotel. I am so surprise when I found the evelators does not has a access. Guests and/or someone can go anywhere into the building without the key-card tab.

      "30 Below my expectations Before visiting Veranda resort, I have been to other Sofitel properties and I must say I’m quite a big fan. I heard good things about this property and it looked like an Instagram dreams. However, when we arrived at the hotel, the room was not ready and we had to move to different rooms. We had to wait til 3 pm before we were able to check in to the rooms. Even though the rooms look new, they have an old smell. I bought a freshener to spray in my room but it did not help much. There’s also constructions going on in the area nearby and I could hear it from my room.    If you like to use the gym like me, the gym here closes at 8 pm and it may not be suitable for some guests.    The highlight of the property is it’s swimming pool. It is new and has a cool design.

      "50 World class hospitality, beautiful hotel We stayed at Veranda for two nights as a family, three generations, four adults and a child. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed the stay. The hotel is beautiful, ultra modern with gorgeous pools and clean private beach. It is spotless, very well-maintained and tastefully designed. Our rooms were on the top floor and had beautiful views of the sea and Pattaya city. The amenities in the room were really hard to fault, well equipped (safe, fridge, complementary water) with plenty of lovely products. The only thing I would suggest to improve is brighter lighting in the bathroom.    All staff we came into contact with were kind, helpful and graciously friendly. They went out of their way to please and seemed to enjoy seeing us having a good time. My mum fancied something not on the breakfast menu. They took it on stride and happily accommodated her request. This is Thai hospitality at its best.    Breakfast was fantastic, really wide range of cuisines and choices. There even was a stall serving up made-to-order noodles. There are also cosy looking coffeeshop and few other venues on the premises but we did not get to try them all.    We will definitely come back next time we come to Pattaya. montonx wrote a review Feb 2018\n",

      "40 A happy and restful New Year at Veranda Pattaya Bottom Line, if you are in Pattaya with family and like comfort and a bit of luxury, this is a great place, well located place to stay. Highly Recommended.    This is a beautiful new hotel far enough away from the craziness of Pattaya but close enough to get to it. 2 families with kids 10-13.    Let's start with the room. Family Pool Suite. Very well designed and great for families. Lots of space. The kids loved the curtained off bunkbeds. The sliding doors between the living room, bathroom and bedroom take some getting used to but once you figure it out it's fine. Honestly, we didn't use the balcony plunge pool. Probably will be great for younger kids. Overall, a great room.    Food: Breakfast is excellent. Many cuisines and tastes. Seating is half indoors and outdoors. During hot/rainy seasons, when the place is full, this might create a challenges as the indoor section is not very large. So, if busy and you want air, come early or late. We joined the NYE's party, which was a great try to mix family and adult activities. The buffet was fantastic!    Facilities: The pool is separated into 3 parts. Well designed for kids and lounging. Very little shade except in the back kids pool and cabanas (which sun can get through during parts of the day). They have a sandy side area which contains an ice cream shop (Shoops), Burger truck (Burger Burglar), sling chairs and a beach. This is a nice add. They are aware of and working on the slow service so be patient. The shoppe and truck seemed to be staffed by one team. We showed up with 7 people who wanted both burgers and ice cream and it was more than they could handle. So, relax, enjoy the beach and prepare for a wait- in the end the ice cream and burgers were great. As mentioned, they know about this.    While this area is beach, the water is not the crystal clear waters of the islands or Phuket. Not many people in the water here so manage your expectations.    Service: Well-trained, friendly staff at a solid 4-star level. Maids are great and helpful. Front-desk great. Restaurant staff could smile a bit more. K. San and K. Ying, the management, were present and attentive (sometimes we go to places and never see the big bosses). These two were everywhere. Nice job! Check-out is a nice, late noon but that creates a bit of chaos at the end. I'd suggest a better queuing system and allowing in-room check-out . Waiting to have someone check your mini-bar is a dated-practice. Hopefully they can work around that.    Location: This is a well-placed location. A new bypass will be opening nearby in the new year or so and their is a lot to do in Jomtien. You are minutes from the floating market, Carton Network water park, the marina. It's also a short ride inland to Rama Yana water park, the Sheep farm, Silverlake winery, Buddha mountain and the ever so amazing upside down house ;^).    Guest Profile: This was a holiday weekend (New Years). The guests were a wide mix of Thai, European, Russian and Chinese. Since this is a high end hotel, the guests seemed to be 'well-trained' travelers. Adventravler wrote a review Jan 2018\n",
      "50 Very cozy and really nice staffs I and my wife stayed there for 1 night during New Year eve. Lots of people there but all staffs are never stop smiling.    The hotel is not that big but it feel like went to a whole different place with fabulous room and view. Loving THANN brands in the bath room. We definitely come here again!! navanuch10 wrote a review Jan 2018\n",
      "40 What you see in the pictures is even better in person! My partner and I have recently stayed at Veranda Resort Pattaya MGallery by Sofitel and really enjoyed our stay. Customer service was of a high standard and they were helpful. The king size bed was very large and the room was much bigger than I had expected. Breakfast was nice, and had Western and Asian varieties. It was our anniversary and Veranda Resort was lovely enough to give us a complimentary cake. I would just like to flag if you want to be within walking distance to Walking Street and the shopping mall this wouldn’t be best place to stay – although it is only 15-20 minutes by taxi (will cost you 200-300 baht). However, if you prefer to relax and be away from the hustle and bustle this is definitely the place for you. Aleli O wrote a review Jan 2018\n",

      "30 Great pool and nice staffs Pros: Nice pool and there are many good views to take a photo, Staff named \"Tommy\" at restaurant served us with care and friendly. Breakfast line is less than expectation but food tastes are ok.    Cons: Room is kinda plain compared with price, on the morning time after taking breakfast, I would like to swim but no staffs standby where is a place that another staffs told to get towels. It seems everyone busy for serving even I called them. Idsaree L wrote a review Jan 2018\n",
      "40 Nice hotel, Nice pool... Good choice to stay, a bit pricey It was a very nice hotel, room was fine, the pool was very nice. Breakfast was ok.  But somehow, for some reason, I didn't feel anything special about this hotel. It was another nice hotel, and nothing to blame, met its standard.    .... It just didn't embedded something special like Cape Dara, another choice nearby. The price was not cheap as well. Momofagal wrote a review Dec 2017\n"

      "50 Nice design, comfortable stay The third veranda visit after been to Chiang Mai and Huahin, honestly i love Veranda Pattaya. The location is 5-minute drive from Pattaya floating Market and it might not convenience for people who would like to go out during the day without car. Forget it ! as the hotel provides everything, very nice design of the hotel. I booked ocean front which i never had an excellent experience before, you can stay in the room and couldn't ask for more ! The room is big enough with bathtub with pool & sea view, toiletries THANN brand which is Veranda signature. They provide 4 bottles of water in the room and i think you can ask if you need more.    For breakfast is good and variety of foods such as Dimsum, Soy Bean, Waffle, american breakfast, congee and noodles. For dinner, if you are looking for seafood, you can walk to Uncle Sawai or Poo-Pen just 5 minutes walk along the beach and you can find convenience store and small local market there as well.    The highlight is the excellent pool, you can't missed it. Try it ! Really recommended. Veranda Pattaya will be 1st choice for my next visit. alittlesomething wrote a review Dec 2017\n",

      "10 M Gallery under Mercure Standard Your property presented as the 5 stars property but you still need to charge 50THB for the 2nd bucket of Ice cube this is totally unaccepted for M Gallery Property and for Platinum guest who spent almost 300 USD a night!!! Totally dissappointed and the breakfast quality is pretty bad, less variety, low quality and taste less compared to Pullman or another property with the same category. Secondly is about private function in the hotel that you never inform the guest upon checked in orneven set the letter to the guest room that may faced the disturbance form your function, my room is facing the pool and at the night time after midnight the staff from the function still do the light testing that so disturb the guest who stay in the ocean front room, I need to call twice until they stopped. I knew that the event may caused a lot of revenue for your property but in the other hand it wasn't the guest false who come to stay during the date but you make your Platinum guest felt nothing while stay in your property. This should be my first and Last visit to your property and please re think about the standard and the service quality as the M Gallery property because this is the worst Experienced in M Galley ever!!!

      "50 Nice design hotel in Pattaya Only location that I feel a little inconvenience as surrounding the resort has a lot of construction but once you came in the property was very nice and clean. Property is new and has good maintenance. All staffs are friendly and polite, Executive Chef was walking around and check for our satisfaction about his food and we can say that we had great lunch their and their Thai Cuisine was really great.  Khun Cee from the reception had a great service mind and we really felt personal touch from her even we said if you cannot it is still fine for us but she did everything on her best.    All the service made us feel one night was not enough for us even we tried to extend stay but we were in bad luck. But sure that when we have plan to Pattaya again Veranda will be our place there. chollanar wrote a review Nov 2017\n",
      "50 Little paradise corner My boyfriend and I both loved our stay at Veranda. The design of the room, the hotel, the service, was excellent in every details.    Veranda has an ocean theme, not only the ceiling of the reception was \"under the sea\" there was even a squid on my bed (i loved it but it was 3000thb to take home). Despite the fact that not all of the staff understand very well English, they sincerely wanted to help and were really polite.    The room was lovely and really clean (5 stars, I cannot find any dirt). The shampoo smelled super nice (they sell everything but I couldn't take everything home). We had 4 bottles of complimentary drinking water, and little fruits and biscuits everyday.  The pool was excellent day and night, during our stay there was not too many people, we had our snack served at the sun bed and watched the sunset. You can even rent a floating unicorn.    We do like to mention about their SPA, one of the best massage we've ever had. We had thai massage with herbal compress, the pressure was adjusted according to your needs and follow your respiration. Super clean, super professional, excellent experience.    For those who critic, please understand that the hotel was opened in March 2016. I personally worked for an opening of a hotel, and it was always a mess. They need time to figure out what to do and now they did it. We were very sad to leave and big big thank you to Veranda Pattaya, we hope to come back one day. denisebok wrote a review Nov 2017\n",

Price of the hotel for 10 nights was better than to say “it’s cheap”. It’s great for couples. Swimming pool area is perfect. Breakfast has got various foods, including sushi, which are my favourite!!

      "40 Nice hotel with a beautiful view of the sea This is a nice hotel with nice rooms, an infinity pool, a great view of the sea.    The room we got was beautiful with a spacious walk-in closet/ bathroom area. There are two pools, an infinity pool and a smaller one beside it. Both have several covered lounges and the usual lounge chairs scattered all over the area. There's a jacuzzi beside the infinity pool too.    The restaurant at the upper floor has a rooftop area with a beautiful view of the beach. Dinner there is a must.    The hotel itself is well maintained and seems to be relatively new. There is also a Family Mart convenience store within walking distance if you forgot to bring toiletries. Aculeus wrote a review Oct 2017\n",

      "50 Nice hotel inspired by Thai Hospitality This hotel was introduced to me by a Thai friend.    Welcome drinks and towel was offered upon check in and like the Thai amenities Thann. Good smell and high quality.    Room is clean and spacious and thumb's up to housekeeping, room is very well make up and staff is very helpful.    A full set up of Thai breakfast that is good for Asian too, also, another set of breakfast has set up for westerner.    Attractive price for F&B options and weekend buffet is just Thai baht 999+ per person.    Location is conveniently to some key tourist attraction - within 10 mins to floating market, 20 minutes to Outlet Mall and Weekend Market. 30 minutes drive to Central Shopping Mall and hotel offers shuttle service only Thai baht 100 person from hotel to Central Shopping Mall.

      "10 low quality materials and unprofessional staffs We travel there with my wife ,the troubles start when we interest to book the hotel, we suddenly call the hotel and they said they will send us the price with bank transfer info.  We 100% sure that we informed the correct email to them. We waiting like 2 hours without any notification from them that they sent already, we found no email and we call and give them again the email. Finally we got an email they sent to wrong email 'typed gmail wrong to gmila' this crazy trouble must be solve.    We have another 3 mains issue with the hotel  1) low quality material it not a 100% concrete the door are not soundproofing  2) unprofessional management of staffs, the process of check in-out processing without any glad or smile, the bread store in the ground floor she bake the bread too well-done (fired)  we can not eat...  3) the decoration are great but every decoration/interior stuffs especially closet and toilet part it appears the large scratch  (Wonder when we sitting on the toilet bowl and there are a large scratch behide the closet lid)    The one start we give is for foods (the shrimp caviar with avocado), glass noodle, krapow mhoo    The hotel outside is beautiful but inside is poor  we've seen that they're expanding the area of hotel so what I suggest is HOTEL should build all completely 100% with QUALITY materials and open in one time... Price is freakly crazy expensive we can spend 2 night on another 5 starts hotel with 1 night price of this Oat R wrote a review Sep 2017\n",

      "40 Beautiful infinity pool, service-minded staff and nice landscape at lobby I'm writing review this trip based on Family travelling with 2 years and 8 month toddler. First of all, we'd been there during the Thailand's long weekend - Mother's day. So, it took a bit longer travelling than expected by the traffic congestion from Bangkok to Pattaya.    The hotel's location is acceptable, you need 10 minutes more from Southern Pattaya, but, it's more peaceful here. There is also a condominium in front of the hotel that is sharing the same entrance, we just need to drive through and will see the drop-off area. During my visit, no Bell man was show up there and later it caused a delay delivery of our stuffs after check-in.    There are lots of parking lots which is well prepared as Pattaya is also a place where local Thai are commonly choose to visit during the long weekend.    From the drop-off, you need to walk down to the lobby. The pavement is nice, also there is an escalator for wheel-chair available at this area too. The check-in process is very fast, they need just an ID to identify and serving a very nice lemon shake in the cocktail glass.    Front desk is professional, she can answer all my queries with confidence. In addition, she also suggested a promotion of the Mother's day dinner for us - it's free for mother. I was not hesitate to accept that promotion and she escorts me and family to the hotel's restaurant and I did ask for a 'Reserved' as I knew more people will coming on this special occasion. The Restaurant's staff even shows me the desk at the window inside was reserved to our family.    It's nearly 5.30 PM when we checked in our room. The size of room is big and can see part of the Sea view. You can check the hotel floor plan to understand more about this hotel's design. A baby cot has been provided to our son, and please note it's an over-sized one which is capable for 4-5 years child.    The best thing was they did provide a surprised Birthday's chocolate cake to me in the room as well. Thank you my wife who told the hotel to prepare.    We spent around 30 mins to celebrate the birthday's cake, however, our luggage were not coming. I understand by the numbers of guests, but, 30 mins was too much. We wanted to see the sundown at the beach and my son needed to change his swimming suit to play there. We got them and ready around 6PM and rush to the beach.    The Beach is quite small but it's enough for the kid to enjoy his sand castle. We can see a beautiful sunset from the beach and pool. Everything went well until we came back to the restaurant and 'that restaurant's staff' told me our \"Reserved\" was taken by using only word \"We reserved as well\".    Luckily, another lady's staff was quickly set up another desk for our family before I was more upset. She handled us very good and provided a good services. The buffet was not good and not bad. Prawn was good, but the crab was not, other line of food is at standard.    The bed in the room is extra big, it can be for 4 persons by the extra large King's Size bed in our room. We had a very good sleep.    The Breakfast was crowded with people, the baby seat were plenty and enough for all guest. The line of food is OK at standard, the one for Vegetarian is a plus. The atmosphere in the outside zone nearby the infinity pool is nice. You can feel the sea breeze whilst hearing the small waterfall from the pool.    After the meal, we went through the roof top at 4th floor to see the Sea from the Top, which is hi-light of visitors. However, it design to visit at the evening, not at noon.    We spent our second day in the hotel all-day. Unfortunately, there is no Kid's club here. Hence, we need to find the activity to our son by hopping around the hotel from the beach, Ice-cream shops to Coffee shop. Lastly, we decided to visit the Coffee shop nearby the lobby as a place to prepare lunch meal for our son. I found another great staff here. She provided the 'hot water' to boil a food for our son by the appropriated pot. When I asked for the water for my boy, she chose the plastic glass. She did it with her truly care in every steps, I can say.    We decided to visit SPA as well, as it was another signature of Veranda resorts. The room and spa were all good.    In summary, I can say you will meet a very good staff here. There are two buildings, the building one will be nearby the sea which you can enjoy the sea view. The Restaurant is questionable to me. To be fair, if there is not too much crowded people, it might be better. The room is exceptional and the spa is very good to retreat yourself from the stress. Narin N wrote a review Aug 2017\n",

      "50 Meeting We were looking for a place to host a one-day client workshop in Pattaya. This hotel is of resort style but we found it perfect for our event as we didn't want to host the event at a standard business hotel. The meeting room was excellent and our clients enjoyed the lunch and coffee breaks a lot. The hotel's atmosphere was relaxing and the staff were professional and helpful. Special thanks to the sale staff (Ananya and Komsan) and F&B staff (Natthawiroj). The coordination between Bangkok office and the team in Pattaya was perfect.

      "50 Some hiccups but great service recovery On a very short trip in the area, we decided to book the place for one night.  Overall, the resort is a tower with good seaviews from the room.  Rooms are quite large and the bed is over-sized.  I would recommend them to change the daybed on the balcony which is not comfortable at all. Additionally, when sitting on the balcony, you cannot really see well the sea... quite a shame...  We arrived very late and the staff was helpful to operate promptly, however they had forgotten that we needed an extra-bed (which we had paid for). Since it was very late (2 or 3 am), it took them a good 15 minutes to bring it but we all had fallen asleep in the large bed. Again, 15 minutes to bring an extra-bed is pretty efficient but it should have been ready beforehand. Anyhow, upon check-out the General Manager (Khun Ying) was prompt to cancel the charge. She was very visible in the hotel especially greeting guests during breakfast. Good job !  Breakfast location is good, however I don't understand why the designer blocked the stunning sea view... It probably would have been better to locate this one floor up... meal is alright with a reasonable choice...  The pool is very nice although a bit cold in the morning and everybody seems to enjoy the beautiful color and scenery...  We certainly can recommend the place for a stylish stay... the area seems to be booming so it will be interesting to see how this evolves... Hakunamaatata wrote a review Jul 2017\n",

There was an excellent choice of Thai and European dishes for breakfast which was served in The I Sea restaurant on the 4ht floor.    We had dinner on one of our evenings in the rooftop I Sea Sky restaurant. Beautiful views of the sunset from this incredible restaurant. The mood lighting and music were the perfect setting for our celebratory dinner.    Don’t forget enjoy they spa too.

      "30 \"good\" I staied at the family suite last weekend, overall is was good, but I would like to provide some of my comments to management.    1) the check in on saturday took some times, I think it took almost 15 minutes as there were only 3 staffs at the check-in counter. The hotel could have done a faster check-in if there were more staff. After all, the check in counter was the hotel's 1st impression    2) Room no. #2401, the air condition at the master bedroom made clicking sound every few minutes. You can't really hear it during day time, but at night time, my 64 years old mom could not get a good sleep. However, we already reported this to the housekeeper.    3) Breakfast at the lobby level were packed, therefore, we had to move up to the 4th floor restaurant where they also served breakfast, however, everything was COLD. From buffet food until pancake to soymilk, even the cappuchino was not a hot cappuchino. This is the first time I staied at a sofitel chain hotels and was served COLD breakfast. However, when informed to the hotel staff, they warm the soymilk for the second order.    4) Cake at the bakery shop was buy 1 get 1 free in the evening which is very good deal. I ordered two, the hotel staff used her hand to pick up the cake. Eventhough, there is a plastic wrap around the cake, I still think there should be something to be used to pick the cake up instead of using her bare hand. However, she was very smiley and attentive.    Apart from that, the hotel was beautiful, the family suite with 3 meters swimming pool is nice and well equipped and the hotel staff are polite and nice. Intoxn K wrote a review Jul 2017\n",

      "20 Nice place with rude staff On 4th June I decided to come to veranda with my friend for a couple of cocktails by the pool. We arrived there around 2pm and that day was my birthday. The place was super quiet and empty, I placed the order with pool staff and after couple minutes the man approached me and introduced himself as Khun Tom (the manager) he informed me that I have to pay 500 baht per person if I want to stay near the pool. I didn't hide the fact that I'm not staying at the hotel, but I kindly asked if it's possible to let me stay there without the additional charge as there were no any signs about it. I said that there are no any guests by the pool, I've already made order and we will not stay longer than 40 min. I also informed that it's my birthday, so Khun Tom nicely apologized and said for this time I may stay but next time we will be charged and I was satisfied.    Since 20 min another angry man run to me and my friend and presented himself as F&B director, Som. He started shouting at me that after 10 min I have 'to get out of the hotel' otherwise he will call police. I tried to talk to him but he didn't give me a chance. He didn't even asked me about to pay this 500 just to get out. I told him that I will leave comment on TripAdvisor about the issue and he said:\"I don't care you don't stay with us.\"    Than we just quietly left, but, frankly say, such respected chain as Sofitel can't afford directors with such rude attitude towards guests. I'm working at 5 star hotel in bkk and flexibility is a priority. Dearest Senior management please kindly follow up on this case, overall, your property is beautiful just bring some better people in it.  Thank you. Daria S wrote a review Jun 2017\n"

      "40 Relatively New Hotel The hotel is quite new with nice beach and view from the beach. The area by the pool is good for taking pictures. The bathtub is located next to the bed so it could be a little shy if you are staying with your friend. The welcome drink was refreshing; service was alright. Given the price it was fair. Unfortunately, the mirror by the bathtub was not clean at all. Ching Yu H wrote a review May 2017\n",

The resort itself is out of town centre of Pattaya, approx 10 minutes by taxi. The resort offers a shuttle bus that rakes you into town centre, cost is 100 baht per person for drop off. Taxi is available at a cost of 300-500 baht, however coming back to resort can be difficult as it is not well known.    Nothing around the resort to look at.    The beds are very hard, however when mentioned to the staff they tried to rectify with a topper. Didn't really help. This is the norm with beds in Asia.    Massage was great the ladies were very professional. Great price with discount.    The managers cocktail party was a lovely surprise and welcomed. The manager himself and I assume it was his wife, both polite and friendly people.    All staff could do with more training in English, very hard to communicate.    Overall we had a great relaxing stay, we had booked for 5 nights however had to fly home early for a funeral. This was explained to staff and we were only charged the one night and had the other night taken from our bill. Charges for food, drink and massage were paid for with the night we were charged for. So thank you very much for the compassion shown, it was great appreciated. Rebecca B wrote a review May 2017\n",

      "40 excellent boutique resort on the beach located on jomtien beach , quiet location, not a high rise but rooms decor is elegant, outdoor pool, right by the beach, breakfast excellent, overall service is good.  missing is activities for the guests which is very common nowadays in the resorts to keep the kids and adults busy with games etc. Suresh M wrote a review Apr 2017\n",
      "50 Memorable experience A quick 1 night stay but a memorable experience. Staff are nice and helpful. Being an Accor Plus member so I got spicial benefits such as 1. Upgraded to a Sea Breeze room which was very nice and on top floor of the building. My partner and I really loved it. 2. 2. Special welcome drinks at Wave Bar. Also we arrived on Wednesday which was the day they offered weekly cocktail party so we joined it. The other designs of the resort was also very beautiful so we took a lot of pictures by the pool and on top of the I Sea Sky Restaurant (Jetty) where we received 50% Disc. as an Accor Plus member.(3). Thank you for everybody's service Tobisabi wrote a review Apr 2017\n",
      "30 Surprised The map on booking.com gives the wrong location, it shows the hotel at the beginning of Jomtien beach when is is in Na Jomtien, a few kilometers further. The hotel has only a tiny private beach on high tide. To access Jomtien beach you have to walk 10 min. and more since the \"tuk-tuk\" buses do no come close to the hotel.  Rooms are spacious, well decorated and comfortable. Amenities are high standard. It is worth it after you get over the surprise of being so far from the main beach. Personally I had to stay since I had prepaid my room... bad decision.  Soundproofing with the top floor was not very good in the evening. I discovered my room was just under the 4th floor restaurant and I heard the noises of tables and chairs when they were slid on the floor.  Since it is a little far there is a small choice os restaurants close but a 10 min walk brings you to a few good seafood restaurants at the beginning of Jomtien Beach road. Room service was disappointing but the buffet breakfast has a very good choice and is worth it.  The clients are mostly Asian arriving by bus and there are many families with young children  The pool is very nice and in full sun. Note that it seems to be the perfect spot for selfies at the end of the afternoon... young people even get dressed for the occasion... this changes from the il fitting uniforms the waiters have to wear.

      "10 A shame to the Sofitel brand I am writing this review after checking out of the Veranda hotel, after spending only one night out of the three scheduled.    Booked two rooms for three nights through Expedia. Expedia mentioned a Seabreeze room with ocean view. Even though the Veranda website mentions the same, we were given a room with no ocean view and were told that the next day we will have a room with an ocean view. Next day, we were told that what we got was the ocean view room. The room view is in the attached picture...    Asked for a refund since the hotel was unable to provide what I paid for but was denied because the booking did not allow for cancellation. This is a ripoff !!! Unacceptable from a brand like the Sofitel ! The least they should have done is to reimburse the two nights that I did not spend. The normal would have been to also reimburse the first night during which they failed to deliver what I booked!    Staff very rude and unwilling to accommodate. Struggled to have access to manager who was even worse than his staff... Most of the staff seem unable to understand basic English !    The property is nice and rooms are well decorated, though with very limited storage space.    Location is extremely bad ! Local taxis were unable to find it without the help of my GPS.  Construction site next door. Shuttle service from the hotel is very poor. Front desk staff recommended on of their friends to drive us to Pattaya central for an expensive fare... next day after check out we asked for a hotel shuttle to drive us to the Hilton. But we were provided with a local Van definitely not the hotel shuttle ...    Check google maps with terrain view and you will see that the hotel is in the middle of no where !!!

      "30 Nice Hotel but Services are far below the standard Nice Hotel with a great view, you could actually enjoy your holidays away from the busy Pattaya with your friends or family. You also could find some good restaurants around the hotel. However, their management should raise the \"Hospitality\" Spirit for their staffs. There were too much things happened during our stay with my family and We kept complaining about the services of them. David See my world wrote a review Mar 2017\n",
      "20 Need improve their service. The hotel service need more improve. When I checked in the reception told us that we have complimentary mini bar for everyday. The first night I rung the reception to reconfirm that VIP treatment. The staff told me \"Yes, everything in the mini bar, we can have it.\" The next day, the housekeeper clean our room replace the drink inside the bar. My husband went to swimming pool and I went to Spa to book the appointment, When I back to the room, open the minibar, all drinks are gone only 4 bottles of water left. I went to ask my husband I thought he took the drinks to the swimming pool. Of course he didn't. I went to reception to ask , they said they make mistake, the complimentary drinks without alcohol ( no beers). That's why they took all drinks out. Unbelievable!!!. Without any noticed and came to our room took all our drinks from the bar. Bad service I never experience before. b0nnick wrote a review Mar 2017\n"

      "40 New & Fresh Sorry for late review; I stayed here since April last year, the hotel was recently opened, the room was very fresh, love the decor and the extra-large mattress was my favourite. The hotel's quite a compact size, swimming pool is bright and refreshing, breakfast wasn't special though sufficient. Hotel restaurant is acceptable; not particularly nice and rather too dark to eat. Overall was great  Ps. as a member, I was to be offered additional privileges that I had to remind the staff for all those, they should operate much smoother by now, I suppose KrisScotch wrote a review Feb 2017\n",
      "30 Nice hotel but poor environment The hotel is surrounded by the construction of a tower which make noise and the nearby environment is not very enthusiastic... All this should disappear soon but is not nice for the moment... Problem with electronic cards which need to be changed every other day... The pool is very nice but almost no one around to take care of clients (drinks, towels etc.). The sky restaurant is great in the evening with a wonderful view. But absolutely nobody in the other restaurants! Many groups when we were there which make you feel not really at home. Rooms and bathrooms are fine and staff is globally very nice.

      "50 Beautifully designed hotel with impecable service and excellent food. Having stayed many times at the Veranda Resort and Spa in Cha Am we decided to try this new addition to their hotel group. We were not disappointed .  From the moment we arrived the staff were friendly and attentive. The hotel design is very modern but with subtle neutral colours, enhanced by the use of wood, wicker and stonework.  There was an excellent choice of Thai and European dishes for breakfast which was served in the downstairs restaurant which had a large outside dining area as well as an inside air-conditioned section.  The I Sea restaurant on the 4ht floor has both inside and outside dining with additional rooftop space.  We had dinner on one of our evenings in the rooftop I Sea Sky restaurant. Beautiful views of the sunset from this incredible restaurant. The mood lighting and music were the perfect setting for our celebratory dinner.  The pool and sundeck areas are well designed and spacious with a sandy beach area to the side of the pool with great relaxing beanbag type chairs which are great for having a relaxing cocktail whilst watching the sunset over the sea.  I'm sure we will be back. Barbara S wrote a review Feb 2017\n",

      "50 Romantic, Relaxing and excellent service This is the first time we stay here. We spent 2 nights at the room 2618. We selected the seascape ocean view room because we like the room that has balcony. The decoration of the room and the hotel is beautiful and romantic. The gym and the spa also very good. The spa service is very impressive. The breakfast has variety of food with good quality and delicious. We incidentally broke the coffee press glass and we told the reception when checked out. The first question that she response is \"Are you got hurt from the accident\" that's very touch to us. The reception was very nice, polite and also exempt the incidentally cost for us. We do definitely come back. We like Veranda brand and we often stay at Veranda Chiangmai. Chaicharn D wrote a review Feb 2017\n",
      "50 One of the Best Hotel I've Stayed At I love this hotel!! First of all, when you check in, they serve you this delicious icee drink and a cold towel. Service is impeccable. Staff are polite and helpful. They go out of their way to make your stay comfortable. The rooms are very clean. They use Thann products which I love! They give you welcome fruits and a cute keychain. The shower contains a huge rain shower faucet.  The next morning I visited the breakfast buffet which was included with the room reservation. It was delicious. The western food (i.e. Bacon, ham, cheese, pancake, yogurt etc) are not that good. But the Thai food (located outside) is much better. I was only able to stay one night and didn't get to hang out at the beautiful pool and the spa. But I will definitely book this hotel again if I head that way. I can see myself spending a week there. mikachu wrote a review Feb 2017\n",

      "30 Nice, could be better We spent a week at the Veranda hotel. The design is amazing, very beautiful and modern. The staff is more than kind, always very helpful. To my point of view they should receive a serious training for their English as they are not easy to understand and they do not understand well what we are saying. The food is very good, Thai as international. The swimming pool is amazing, very clean, wide, well equipped, overlooking the sea. Do not try to swim in the sea. It is highly polluted. After 4-5 baths I got a serious dermatological problem. The hotel is a bit remote so it is not easy to go out and you will have to all on an ugly road or stay at the hotel for every meal. The air conditioning is too powerful and noisy and you cannot change it as it seems to be set by default. In spite of that we appreciated our stay, due to the beauty of the place, the quality of the amenities and the amability of the staff. Francoise L wrote a review Jan 2017\n",

We had a long long travel around Thailand and soud-west Asian, when we arrived on Jomtiem everithing was wrong, some people fake us and we arrived late we were lost and we didn't had place to sleep, a deception.  But all changed when we see Nancy, Veranda hotel appear from nothing and she was so nice with us, she talked to us, she helped us, she showed the rooms before pay... we did the reservation with her and se was worried about everithing in our staged on Pattaya, get taxi to go island or inform to go to buy everithing.  We are so happy to stay in this amazing hotel with magnífic facilities, a great swimming pool, an excellent breakfast, nice views and of course awesome and kind people, that's very important thing the human team and here starting from Nancy to every one it is perfect.

      "40 Mixed feelings It is a beautiful hotel, both in design as well as location, but my kids were not happy with some facilities. No kids club, swimming pools have no special items such as slides. I came to the conclusion that this hotel is looking for the typical couples ( young or old), who want a relaxing place with excellent spa treatment.    The beach area is OK, but not well maintained. Don't really know if they are the owner, looks more like public beach.    For families with children I know better places in same area.    It should also be mentioned that the access to the hotel is not easy. Huge projects are being realized presently all around that area. It will take some years before it is a well developed area with a unique infrastructure. Daniel K wrote a review Jan 2017\n"

      "50 Amazing stay!! We have just returned from our trip to this hotel in Pattaya. Their staffs have been a great experience which makes a very friendly atmosphere, they are amazing with the typically warm Thai personality. The beach front location is very beautiful. The beautiful pool overlooking the beach is also amazing. We had snack and ice cream at Skoop Beach Cafe which was incredible. Great dinner at The I Sea Sky, all seafood are fresh and delicious. The buffet breakfast has all kinds of selections of any kind of breakfast you could think of. The Suite room was very beautiful, modern, well decorated, overlook the ocean and tidy, we thoroughly appreciated and enjoyed, there is a large balcony with sofa and cushions and of course Jacuzzi!!

      "50 Indescribable.... Overall decoration has really great and it not look like we were staying in Pattaya. The hotel location has really calm and private. We stayed for only one night(11-12Jan17) with Ocean view's room type. The bathtub located in front of the ocean view. It has really nice for relaxing. And one good point, I really like your amenities set (soap, shampoo, body lotion and hand wash) made from \"Thann\" which has premium quality and famous spa brand. The jetty restaurant such a romantic dinner place where a couple should go for. And luckily our room include cocktail party and your staff team surprised a special lucky draw during party and we got it !! :)  Breakfast has fully line and optional but we were not offer omelet menu until we asked for this by ourselves.

Both types are spacious compare with most other hotels. Twin beds are queen size beds (which is incommon in Thailand) and you can request the hotel to connect them as a huge bed. As parents with 2 kids, we really love it. The service is standard with no pros and cons. The hotel is located by the sea but hv small sand beach. No kids'club and the hotel's layout is not kid friendly. yongcharoenfarm c wrote a review Jan 2017\n",

Sat by the pool, which was very well modern design and had a great veiw.    As we were staying on New Year Eve we decided to have the festive seafood buffet party on the beach wow wow we were absolutely enjoyed it , the range and quality of food available was first class, jazz music on stage and again the staff were attentive and friendly.

      "40 Modern style hotel with privacy in Pattaya area This is a very nice and new hotel in Pattaya. It's location is perfect for those who would like to enjoy Pattaya as well as the beach. It may be more suitable for a couple who would like to have a relative privacy. Family trip with elders and small kids will not enjoy the atmosphere as much as the young couples. The hotel facilities are well decorated and quite unique especially the swimming pool and the beach front terrace. It is nice to enjoy sitting and swimming in the evening to watch the sun setting. Rooftop dining offers nice view of the beach. Breakfast is excellent. Staffs are very friendly. There are many foreigners staying in this hotel, hence, communication should not be a problem. Our room has partial view of the beach and the nearby condominium view despite the relatively high floor we are on. It is decorated in modern style which is not practical in some issues and not a homey style For those who do not care that much on the view from the room, it is fine. Considering that the price of the room is not cheap comparing with other property nearby, purpose of stay is the issue to determine the value for the money for this hotel.

Out of the way of metered taxis, the hotel transport starts at THB300 even for a three minute ride.    Fancy design of hotel rooms leave toilet, shower and most of the bathroom area exposed to the rest of the room. Bath tub is in the main bed room! Not attractive layout.

We did use it and was very nice.    The only complaint is that we got a free dinner of a set menu in night one - we got 15 courses for 2 people which was too much for us - but very nice if you are hungry. To management save some food and serve a bit less :). But was delicious either way. Khunjeng wrote a review Nov 2016\n"

      "50 A very nice place to relax and unwind! From our first experience arriving at Veranda, we knew we had found a very nice place to kick back and relax. We were met by Khun Thanvadee, who spoke excellent English and who made us feel that we were very special guests. Check in was easy and professional. The staff at the resort all seem to speak at least some English, but most guest facing staff speak excellent English, which helps since I speak very little Thai.    The rooms were very nice except for a few minor issues I will outline later. Towels, robes and the bed were top quality! If you travel in Thailand, you know that beds can be a problem. The bed was excellent, and both my wife and I enjoyed them. We had a room with a tub, and it was very nice. My wife loves her soaks, and the tub was clean and modern. She definitely spent a fair amount of time enjoying it. ;)    Khun Natthawiroj (San) is the Food and Beverage Manager there, and I have to say I am impressed with the food, in both restaurants. We went to a locally famous seafood restaurant off the property one evening, and I would say that the seafood platter on the property is better than we got at the famous place, and the view was most DEFINITELY better than the famous place! VERY good! The free breakfast is fabulous, with a wide range of foods for all tastes. I particularly enjoy Eggs Benedict, which are available for breakfast. This is fairly rare in Thailand, so I enjoyed them every day we were there. Service was excellent at all restaurants: attentive and professional without being intrusive! To give you an idea, my wife commented to one of the wait staff that due to us having to leave very early to make our flight, she was disappointed she would miss the breakfast. On her own, Khun Varaporn told us to check with the front desk as we left. She had a breakfast box made up for both of us that was quite good, with boiled egg, croissant, butter, jam, a ham and cheese sandwich, an orange, juice and even condiments, plastic silverware and napkins! This is superior service in my opinion, and I have seldom received this level of commitment anywhere in the world! My wife and I both appreciated Khun Varaorn taking care of us.  Minor glitches:  only one wastepaper basket in the room. There needs to be one beside the table.  the chairs are not very comfortable for old backs. This was not an issue because the bed WAS quite comfortable.  I was excited to see they had French Presses in the room instead of instant or small drip machines. (yes, I love my coffee!) UNFORTUNATELY, the coffee in the room is mediocre at best, even with a French Press. This was a bit of a disappointment. Bring your own if you truly enjoy good coffee. Next time I will.  My wife and I both thoroughly enjoyed our stay and we will return at a future date! Recommended. Ken B wrote a review Nov 2016\n",

The service provided by the staff around the hotel, restaurants etc., was outstanding. The food at both restaurants was delicious.

      "50 Great place to rest! Great staff. Great attention to detail, sympathy and willingness to make things easier for you. Very clean and comfortable room. Good breakfast, suiting both Western and Asian tastes. Amazing sunsets from the beach of hotel. The main swimming pool is cool , it is very nice to see the sunset when you swim in the pool. The food is tasty, fresh and good value. Punne P wrote a review Oct 2016\n",
      "10 Poor service and dirty hotel 6,900 baht per night with very poor service.  Reserved double bed but I got twin bed.  Breakfast, they served hot coffee in a UNWASHED mug (stain was on mug edge) . Dirty bed sheet, there are 3 orange stains.  Crowded people and children like I was in amusement park. Actually kids are not a problem but the hotel are not ready to service big family scale.  Because there are a lot of people, toilet on pool side was very dirty, un-flushed, wet floor, ran out of tissue paper. finknamthip wrote a review Oct 2016\n",
      "30 Nice weekend at Pattaya This is the second time i stayed with Veranda Pattaya resort.I also had a nice moments with my friends and feel comfortable, i would like to compliment Ms ยุ้ย at front desk who treated me so well. Accommodations with modern design,clean and nice bathtub, i highly recommend accommodations on first tower. Services good, staff vary friendly, dinner on rooftop with good view and delicious, lunch at restaurant nice also, just only breakfast need more improvement ( need to compare with another 5 star resort in this area ).  In finally, we very happy when spent our weekend with this hotel but 1 thing made us so confused and disappointed because your staff would charge us for sleepers in room. So in general with another hotel in the world we usually take sleeper for reuse again ( its personal amenity cannot reuse for another person) so you need to collect them for?

      "30 Beautiful hotel but poor service The pool and public area are very nice design. The room is decent size with no bathtub. There is smell in the room, presume an area rug. the door to bathroom is just right at bedhead. We feel uncomfortable and wake up when someone using toilet in the middle of the night.  The breakfast is very limited of choice and quality is poor. No fry rice and sausage is very hard. not friendly meal for kids. We asked to take away 2 pork buns for 2 years old kid from breakfast. The manager ran to us and inform that we can not do that. We understand it is a policy. But please bare in mind it is for 2 years old kid not for adult. If you would like to charge us for that we are ok, but the way they talk to us is a bit disappointed for the hotel that claimed 5 stars like this. No service mind at all.  I do not recommend if you travel with kids to stay in this hotel. Not worth the money. kulaya_b wrote a review Oct 2016\n",

I had reserved \"I see sky\" for dinner during the sunset period, the food was really delicious and that's was an awesome moment with my wife!(Specially thanks for the waitress from Chang mai, she was really nice!)

      "40 A day spent at the Veranda I gathered there with some school friends in June - July for a reunion and spent a day or two. It looked like a new property and neat and clean.    Because it was a reunion and a number of things were pre arranged, I cannot comment on services like room service, laundry et al.    Overall it appeared to be a good property and it has a fantastic beach all to itself. RRamesh wrote a review Oct 2016\n",
      "30 Not completely what I expected.... We had been to Veranda resorts in Chiang Mai and Hua Hin, so expectations were high. On the upside: reception was very friendly, staff is really nice and helpful, always smiling and the layout, especially the pool is beautiful. The restaurants offer very good and a lot of choice of food. WiFi works well everywhere.  But...for the price I paid for a sea-view room I would have expected a balcony. There was a big sliding window, but it's not the same. The restaurant on the 4th floor makes you endure some computer-beat noise which gets on my nerves. The roof top terrace can only be accessed if you order for 2000 baht, even hotel guests are not allowed for just a drink. The pool area offers almost no shade. The music that is necessary to entertain you when walking from the elevator to your room door and finding your key card is so loud that it can be heard inside the room. Al bed time I had to call the reception to ask to turn it off.  So, a nice hotel but for that price I am sure I could have found something better. Dick Z wrote a review Sep 2016\n",

      "30 Averagely Good except for ISEASKY GOOD : Friendly staff especially security guy and staff near front door they are lovely!  BAD: Limited menu and construction view + dust    What the worst thing was the food at ISEASKY.  PARTIALLY WARMED FRIED RICE and SOGGY CALAMARI RING.  It seemed like they cooked it before they take the order.  If its not? then they should change their ISEASKY chef.    Except for this ISEASKY, this hotel is not that bad.  However to pay more than US$180~ for this hotel like me?????  well........... you should find an another option.  In Thailand, there are quite many hotel with US$180 per night.

      "30 Like and dislike Good hospitality and most of functions in the hotel. Things I dont like here are about late room cleaning that interupt my resting time, and too noisy and non privacy regarding the hotel accept customer under 12 without any control from their parents. Also hairdryer in room is broken with a loud noise and burn smelt. By overall, not recommend for a couple who needs privacy. Samon1965 wrote a review Sep 2016\n",
      "40 Great for own beach This is an unexpected hotel i booked so far. Even though this is Veranda brand .  The first step in the check in counter is quick and impressed me for being a member of Accor.  I got a room on the same building of The deck restaurant (Breakfast).  Inside room has bath tub in the center of the room , it may be not appropriate for friend. Bed is big but futon is so hard. I could see the beach from my own balcony . It is so nice.  The pros. of this hotel is swimming pool and strong wind.  Breakfast costs580++(bht.) , variety of food. But quality is ok.  Another restaurant i would recommend is 'Wave restaurant ' situated on 4th. floor - quality of food is so good and tasty. You can have a nice spot of Pattaya360• view on 5th floor in the same building. Don't missed it. Butsagorn J wrote a review Sep 2016\n",

      "40 Lovely food but you need to attend to detail We use the Accor hotels often and as a platinum members of their club this may tell you how much. However we went up to visit this newish hotel and have lunch, first we took a walk about and having seen how wonderful it looked when it opened we were expecting great things. The pool area is stunning but it let down by the filth on the beach clearly once a day is not enough to for keeping this up to standard but no staff were in evidence attending to this. We took at tour of the restaurants and selected the one down stairs . The food was very nice and this was the first time my partner had tried sweet potatoes as French fries so having eaten most of mine he needed more !! The ac in the restaurant is clearly a problem raining down my back so we had to move then at the next table the joint at the ducting above the table leaked too right into our drinks!! The staff at very friendly and speak good English. There is clearly room to change and improve here, but the setting is fantastic and the hotel looks great ! thomas1972NZ wrote a review Aug 2016\n",
      "20 Never again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Fortunately, I stayed here for just a night during 20-21Aug.  Last month, I was introduced by my wife that Veranda chain has newly opened a hotel in Pattaya and we are regular Veranda Hua-Hin customer, so we gave it a try.    This hotel is located by Jomtien beach at the far-end corner. Normally, You won't get to stay by the beach on Jomtien, there will always be a road im-between and cos of the high night tide makes the beach rather private during the day.That might be just a Pros of this hotel to me.    The moment I entered the premise, I found it packed with group of seminar guests and it took us a while to checked in. There is also a construction going on in front of the hotel building a condo of its own called veranda residence which doesn't really give you sense of privacy ( 36 stories building ).    The swimming pool cannot serve 145 rooms guests cos of its size, it is more like a tub to me.The Lift takes forever to come and go since there are only 7 stories, Breakfast quality was good but again due to the vast number of guests in such a small premise you have to wait long queue for tables and food in the morning. Key card didn't work well, my wife and I have to exchange new key cards at front desk twice within 2 days.    Dinner was expensive and limited choice of food, we spent 5K among 5 of us ( 4 Female 1 Male) without alcohol. Spa charged similar fee to other 5 Stars hotel but the quality wasn't that terrific. What pissed me the most was the charge of bicycle fee 100 Baht for such a price I paid for the room, I found that really unacceptable.    What scares me is that I have a reservation in Veranda Hua-Hin (after renovation) during 2-4 Sep 2016 which have been paid for will not depressed me again, should it be I would definitely say good bye to this hotel chain.

      "40 Fantastic property though not of the Sofitel standard The property is nicely tucked away from the noise and activity of Jomtein beach or Pattaya. If you look for such calm and beauty then this is a place to go. The rooms are large and comfortable but better lighting in the wash basin area would be good. It is tough to shave with such little light. The pool, while some say is small, I felt it was perfect. It is stylish and unique. The food is lovely although the bakery / cafe could do with a few more items on its list. There is a responsive team at the reception and generally friendly staff but they still have time to go before they reach the Sofitel level or even the levels of some other McGallery properties. At the restaurant, Waves, Somboon is a stand out guy to have around. Each outlet is interesting including the rooftop Jetty which is so cooling to be at at night. I would return for sure given a chance but would like to see some of these improvements too SharifDRangnekar wrote a review Aug 2016\n",

      "20 Unwelcome ‘no-leg’ friend, Unprofessional service, Not worth it. I wish I have a pleasant experiences at Veranda Beach Pattaya MGallery by Sofitel to share with everyone. Unfortunately, our stay on 23-24 July 2016 with family was unpleasant in many ways. I try to be neutral in my sharing as much as possible.    Let’s start with what we like:-  The bed is big and comfy as advertised  Fresh tasty seafood at the Seafood buffet dinner  Nice pool, clam and relaxing beach    I’m so sorry that are what we can say. Here are the other things we experienced during our 1 night stay.    1) Unwelcome 'no-leg' friend in \"guest room\"    There was a green snake on the bath tub in our room. The emergency response speed and practice were unacceptable. We had to wait for more than 10 minutes to have the hotel staffs on scene.    After the investigation, the hotel staff informed us that the snake may potentially sneaked into the room from the balcony when the maid made up the room because the branches of the tree reach the balcony. If we look at the building layout and where the tree is, it is hard to believe that the snake took a long journey on the slippery wall up to that room.    On a slightly bright side, we did see a wood work going on with the suspect tree on next morning. We compliment on their prompt action.    2) The room doors are \"very poor soundproof\".    I heard door knock from the other rooms many times when I was in the room with TV on. It was loud enough such that we sometimes think that the knock was on our door and we even came to the door to check.    Our room’s door vibrated all the times and created a buzz noise. It was quite annoying. We had to put a piece of paper between the frame and the door to stop door vibration and get rid of the noise.    3) Lifts are poorly designed and low grade material is used.    Electricity went off on July 24 morning and accidentally we were caught in the lift. Electricity returned after a few minutes but the lift door was not opened. We pressed the emergency button and there was no response. We tried to press the open button and luckily that it worked.    4) There is no security system in accessing to guest room floors.    Anybody can access to the guest room floors. No control in the lift to guest floors. For most of the hotels in this class I have been to, only guests on that floor could enter the floor by using their key card.    5) Cleanliness in guests’ room should be seriously attended.    With the snake incident, we checked every corner of the room as we were afraid of another one greeting us. We obviously overly inspected the room than what normal guests should do but what we found was interesting - longan seeds and cobweb under the bed and the cabinet.    6) Service at the pool could also be improved.    We went there on July 24 at 7.30 a.m. - 8.00 a.m. The pool opens at 7 am but there was no pool towels provided at the service station but the used ones were left at the station probably since last night. There was no staffs on service during that time.    The atmosphere was not warm and friendly. I remember my great experience at other hotels we stayed where the staffs were very friendly and helpful. They recognized the guests and greeted them with warmth and respectful. The gardeners paused their work to greet us. Unfortunately, I do not feel welcome the same way here. The staff walked pass the guests with no smiles. Thailand is a land of smile. It is a pity that we cannot find a sincere smile here.    It is sad to say that Veranda fail to meet our expectation. If I have a second chance, I would definitely choose other hotels.    Firstly, I would like to give 1-star rating on the experiences we had. But after carefully considered at every elements, 2-star would be better describe the hotel. d_jring_8 wrote a review Jul 2016\n",

However, i dont like the fact that the resort is not private as anyone can come in to the resort area (even guest room) as there is no key card access to the elevator. Considering paying 6,000THB and not good security its not good.  Moreover, the breakfast is lack of staff. I had breakfast on 7 am and only 1 waitress looking after service area. The chef look confused as i ordered omlette and i never get it even it not busy at all (no one ordering egg). Breakfast quality is good though.

Nevertheless, there are some areas to be improved further such as the level of product knowledge & service of their staff, as they were not able to give us advice regarding drink selections at the bar & more attention to details is required.

I really like the design of the hotel and especially my room, the family pool suite! It is perfect for the family and even friends! Moreover, the pool is big and beautiful. It was so nice, sitting by the beach while sipping some cocktails with your friends.

All the facilities are on real 5 star level.  However - for the next months to come don't expect an indisturbed night, as the owner of the property builds a highrise condominium in the back, overlooking the Hotel and the beach and with clear implication for your good nights sleep.  And on Saturday May 14th they had a rooftop music event which made it impossible, to keep the windows of your room open or to have a chat with the friends on your balcony. Some 3rd class Thai band or DJ annoyed the guests and the surroundings the whole evening with repeating hour over hour the same chords.  Conclusion - a five star resort with a management, which has still to adapt running such a place according to the relevant standards Cormalon wrote a review May 2016\n",

      "20 Expensive and disappointing We wanted to spend a long weekend at this brand new hotel. It became quickly obvious that only the price, but not the service corresponds to 5-star.  The hotel is a top modern. It seems to be popular with well-heeled Thai guests and their families with children. Only a few foreign tourists were present.  The hotel has 137 rooms, with some offering a sea view. The comfort room \"Sea breeze\" had a limited view of the sea. The rooms are generously laid out. The building substance is poor; it shows signs of fatigue already now.  The highlight is probably the comfortable King-size bed with a width of 200 cms. Then we start with the deficiencies that are plentiful. There is no reasonable chair to sit on the desk (actually it is a ledge under the TV. The small coffee table cannot be considered suitable for working with a computer. On the ledge is no electric outlet to plug in the computer.  A large bath tub stands is in the middle of the room. For a 5-star hotel I would expect that bath salts are provided. Why then focus which is a central eye catcher. The shower and the toilet are next to each other. Either the shower cabin or the toilet can be shielded with a sliding door but not both. In addition, the shower lacks a good ventilation.  The breakfast buffet is extensive and of good quality. The food on the buffet dinner was incredibly spicy and even for someone accustomed to spicy food inedible. In spite of the many families with small children no ice-cream was on the buffet. Cakes and fruits were available. Guests have to relay in the hotel food as there are no restaurants in walking distance.    The main attraction of the hotel is the infinity pool which is set in a desolate concrete landscape. In a good hotel someone would expect a beach boy or service an attendant on the poo to help with the umbrellas or handing out towels. The sunbeds are of modern design but most uncomfortable. A concrete staircase leads directly into the sea. The water was murky. On a nearby empty lot in front of the car park a small beach was set with sand that was bought in. The sandy beach was littered with garbage washed ashore. Nobody from the hotel seemed to care to clean the place.    There's \"Happy hour\" at the pool from 04.00 PM. Instead of the usual second drink free, a ridiculous discounts THB 30.- or less than US$ 1.- is given. Despite the high price of the drinks, not even some complementary peanuts or popcorn is served  The hotel is located in a new building area, which looks like a giant construction site. The environment is characterized by unfinished skyscrapers and neglected terrains. The hotel is in a closed compound without access to a beach promenade. Taxis are not available and have to be called from farr with time of 20-30 minutes. The journey to Pattaya costs THB 400.-. The same will be charged for the return trip.  Complaints are ignored. I usually try to discuss problems with the management before putting them online. There was no manager on duty. The effect of well-being at his hotel is missing. The name \"MGallery by Sofitel\" is misleading. Of the normally excellent Sofitel service and comfort; at the Veranda there is little or none.. Thomas R. wrote a review Apr 2016\n",
      "40 Have a good trip I was a long weekend stay. Service Employee Most of the rooms also need to be modified somewhat. Such as chairs, damaged The color of the walls to keep unsettled.

      "40 Not Quite Right I struggled with this report as most of my reports are positive. Having stayed at a number of Sofitel's, this one does not quite make the grade. There were good points yet also many poor points. The swimming pools are excellent and well designed, if you love the sun then these are for you as there is limited shaded areas. Yet trying to get a drink can be a problem at the pool bar! The seafood BBQ was OK but the cooks could not keep up with demand leaving most of serving trays empty, and once full, they were quickly emptied by waiting hungry guests. We took an expensive room with a plunge pool with views over a parking lot and a building site, not what we were expecting at that price. Colin L wrote a review Apr 2016\n",
      "30 small pool The hotel is good and they have a nice outdoor area, but the pool is not big. The water had a \"weird\" smell on it.  The food that we ordered in the pool was nice but the staff was a bit slow, service needs to improve there. GigiDubai wrote a review Apr 2016\n",
      "40 Sweet Escape Brand new opened, ease to commute to from Bangkok. Certainly every where has own charming those you could expect from The MGallery chain. Stayed in Deluxe Room : spacious space, comfy / cozy extra size king bed, various pillow offering , very well organised & functioned, lovely veranda toiletries as natural aroma sort, romantic light up, superb clean & tidy. Perfect big designing pool & its sea view. Variety of healthy favourite breakfast. Food taste is standard . Excellent service.  The hotel still under construction in some spot but still lovable to me. Paweena M wrote a review Mar 2016\n",
      "20 NOT READY!!!! (February 2016) This hotel is not ready to be open. Regardless of the cash flow requirements of the company, they should know that the hotel is not ready to be fully opened.    We stayed on the sixth floor, Room 2610. There were so many construction defects in the room it truly was unbelievable. The laminate decorations on the wall were held up with masking tape, splotches of paint on the floor, terrible paint thinner smell in the hallways. I repeat, this wing of the hotel (or this floor) should not have been open for paying guests.    That being said, this could turn into a very nice hotel...although Jomtien is a terrible beach and the surrounding area off the hotel property leaves a lot to be desired.    The Veranda is also constructing a high-rise condominium behind the hotel, so there is still lots of construction noise.    The common areas of the hotel were nicely designed and the expansive beach-front swimming pool is beautiful (not a lot of shade, not enough sun-brellas).    The hotel needs to complete the interior refurbishments of the room.    Most of the staff were very friendly, but I don't think there were enough to service all the weekend guests.    Breakfast was adequate. The views from the Sky bar are nice for sunset. Viewfrom22 wrote a review Mar 2016\n",
      "40 Brandnew Hotel! Modern and pretty nice pool! Staff is very helpful! Very nice rooms!  Poolarea is excellent, also for kids and even swimmers!  Nice view! Great for sundowners...  The area around the hotel is not that nice.... A lot of construction work! Ralf J wrote a review Mar 2016\n",
      "30 Beautiful pool but not up to scratch or worth the money! We booked for a weekend getaway for two. We arrived on Friday evening at around 8:30pm; there was no one at the drop-off area and so our Uber was confused dropping us off in the multi-story parking garage meaning that we needed to get the lift and carry our own luggage to reception.    Once we arrived at reception there was no one to greet us and after more than five minutes and multiple calls out to the staff some on eventually assisted us with our check-in. There were used welcome drinks on the check-in counter too but none were offered to us.    Friday night was quiet in the hotel, which suited us perfectly. We dined at the upstairs rooftop bar Jetty, which had a super cool ambiance but was empty. We ordered some snacks along with our beers. The bill was expensive.    On the surface our room was fine. It had a comfortable bed and a great shower with warm water and great pressure. We were disappointed that the finishings in the room, especially the wall plastering was not up to standard for a hotel where we were paying top dollar. The Room Service menu was missing from the room directory, which meant that we had to call the front deck first.    The service and friendliness of the staff throughout the weekend was not what it should be at a hotel of this cost. We asked for a taxi to be arranged to take us to a nearby restaurant and it honestly took forever and so we ended up arranging an uber ourselves.    The pool bar / restaurant staff were not very friendly or attentive either and while we certainly can't complain about the quality of the food or the drinks (both were great) the cost was exorbitant.    The hotel is also very far from the city of Pattaya, which we didn't mind, however if you do plan to get a taxi to the city and back be prepared to pay THB 800 return.    The pool and sala areas along with the views from the I SEA SKY restaurant and Jetty bar ware amazing! Despite the poor service, expensive food, shoddy attention to detail in the rooms and being super inconvenient to get to town we enjoyed simply relaxing by the pool all weekend sipping cocktails and snacking on yummy food.    Sadly, we felt that despite this wonderful poolside experience we were left expecting more from the staff and the hotel in general. Graham wrote a review Feb 2016\n"

      "10 Very disappointment trip!!!!!!! Our trip was just only at the weekend and we really disappointment with the staff and environment of the hotel.    First, our room the light bulb broken and the glass cover crack everywhere in the bathroom.    Secondly, at breakfast time we order 4 coffee and every time the coffee is served is never taste the same things and also one of the coffee is served with out of date milk. I also ordered Americano but when it's served it came with milk which is no suppose to served this type of coffee with milk! Please check your staff if they know what they are serving please!!!!    After the situation, the manager who is on duty came and apologise with us and promise to give us 1 pound of cake to say sorry at 10am the next morning BUT IT's did not come at 10pm but they give us at 12pm which 2 hrs later than they have promise and also the cake was only small pieces which is not suppose to be! THEY SAID THAT THEY WILL GIVE A PUOND OF CAKE! What how 5* hotel is like this? The only things is nice about this hotel is just the swimming pool but others Notthing is worth it! We pay so much but we did not get what 5* service should do! Kewalin P wrote a review Feb 2016\n",

They all have good service mind and nice smile all time. Good taste breakfast they have everything you need, AmericanBF, Thai food, Salad, and Bakery. And dinner also awesome. At late night we can hangout on rooftop.  I think i can stay there all day all night !    Very love you, Veranda :) Yuii C wrote a review Feb 2016\n",
      "50 New Top Hotel a bit outside from Pattaya! This is a new 5 star very stylish hotel at Jomtien Beach and not in the crowded and terrible city centre of Pattaya.  The rooms are very cozy special the lovely \"animal' as decoration on the bed.  We loved the rooftop bar and the beautiful swimming pool.  At the water I wouldn't swim at the beach cause is Pattaya and very dirty and not like Koh Samui where the beach is more clean.  The hotel lobby is stunning and completely outside. Breakfast was very good.  The only complain I have to say is of the \"TAXI MAFIA\" in Pattaya. You wouldn't find any Taxi which one goes by taxi meter or less then 350 - 400 Bath from Veranda Resort to the city centre of Pattaya. I know this is not the fault of the hotel but we wouldn't come back to Pattaya or Jomtien Beach cause of this problem. The only reason for me to go to Pattaya was this World Class 5 star resort which one is part of the M Gallery. Globetraveller2014 wrote a review Feb 2016\n",
      "40 Very nice hotel - disappointing surroundings! Very nice hotel with very modern rooms and general layout. Typical Thai standard when it comes to building details but not to bad. Great breakfast buffet. The ocean is not something I would swim in - but some people do - they better not swallow!  Some noise from construction sites  But as soon as you leave the hotel you find yourself far away from shopping and in a typical Thai garbage-hell! I think the Thai people expect that if they throw the garbage in the bushes or along the road it will disappear. So sad that the government/hotels only make sure that the hotel area is clean.

      "40 Hidden gem in Pattaya! This is a brand new resort which has just opened about a month ago! You could still smell the 'newness' in this hotel! Very chic and modern hotel. Hotel is around 1.5hr - 2 hours away from the Bangkok airport. So allow sufficient time for the commuting.    The hotel has a big funky pool and right at the beach! It's not your typical swimming pool I can assure you. Make sure you bring your bathers to this resort! The hotel also has a viewing deck on the 4th floor which offers great views of the ocean and the pool area! Best to visit around sunset and it is simply stunning!    Wifi is fast and no buffering! The rooms are very resort style with a small balcony and a sofa for you to soak in the fresh air! I like the rain shower as it is very strong and it relaxes you!    The food is very good and delicious no matter what cuisine you choose.    Exceptional hotel and will definitely be back with the family! Staff are all very friendly and polite! Well done to the team there and hope to see you all soon! Agape10 wrote a review Feb 2016\n",
      "30 Not Worthy of Luxury Price It is a beautiful newly opened resort. Many taxi drivers are still unsure about the location of the resort. And mostly wants to charge you extra - be careful.    The room still smell of fresh paint. The quality of the workmanship for the furniture is really subpar, especially when it is a luxury resort. The air-conditioning unit is very noisy. The light which is fitted in the minibar cabinet shines through the top and it can't be switched off. It makes the room bright and it's difficult to sleep. The bed linen is of poor quality - rough.    The beach area is relatively small, if you are expecting a large beach area to lounge around on. The resort has very nice cabanas and lounge beds for you to suntan, if you need it.    The reception team was very helpful in getting us the required transportation to the places we needed to go to. The social media team is also very prompt in responding to our queries. Zephyrynn wrote a review Feb 2016\n",
      "30 Not ready to open... Swimmimg pool is great...  They should have shuttle bus to pattaya because in the room guide book wrote. But no..... as i said they are not ready to open.  Workers still work so... not quiet in day time.  Shower Water is weak and not hot enough running out of hot water in 15mins then no water came out at all . Finish with cold water...... very bad experience (they said managed by Sofitel.... stayed at Sofitel so BKK 2 days before this Verada pattaya) Really not enough for 2 persons having shower.  No drinking water no air-con in GYM.  As an A+ member, i am disappointed. rekamaerd T wrote a review Feb 2016\n",

      "50 Stunning! It's only been open for about a month or so, but the Veranda Pattaya is truly a stunning spot; design-wise there's nothing like it in Pattaya, and for anyone looking for a spot away from downtown Pattaya, this has got to be it! Gorgeous rooms and public areas, and lots of great restaurants within walking distance. Favolo wrote a review Jan 2016\n",
      "50 Beautiful Boutique from Accor This hotel has only been open a month and I will be back because the swimming pool design is sensational and the roof top bar perfect for an evening cocktail while watching the sunset. The staff are very helpful and polite, although a little more staff training is needed, especially when it comes to understanding the Accor rewards cards.  However the beach is very dirty and needs regular cleaning from broken glass and plastic bottles. I saw them cleaning the beach but the next day more litter returns.  If you like small beautiful design hotels then this is a must see. Oh the food is very tasty too! TrippingKev wrote a review Jan 2016\n",
      "50 Veranda resort pattaya This is new hotel in Pattaya at na Jomtien.  The design looks very modern and unique.  It has more privacy than center of pattaya.  Location is good for relaxing and not too far from Cartoon networks.  Sunset views in front of the hotel looks very romantic.  I recommend this hotel. Siripoj T wrote a review Dec 2015\n"

      "50 A beautiful boutique style hotel What a fantastic boutique hotel. On my first day despite checking in late I was greeted by a wonderful owner who went out of her way to make me feel welcome. At this stage I have booked for a month but with long stay options I may consider this a permanent home for some time to come. The owners partner even went out of his way to help take my belongings to my room and I am not talking 2 bags I'm talking about a ute full.    The rooms are huge and modern with a very conformable bed. There may not be cooking facilities but I can't cook and Thai food is so cheap why worry.    I can't wait to check out the pool I have read about and see if the TV is a smart TV. So far the Internet is a tad slow but maybe I chose the wrong account and after all it is Thailand.    I cannot offer enough praise and to write a positive review 1 day into my stay is a sign of how impressed I am so far.    5 stars plus and I hope things improve and highly recommend expats or tourists consider this hotel for either a long or short stay.

      "40 Good value A budget hotel on the main road . Only 200 yards to the beach and the complimentary swimming pool.Clean rooms and friendly staff. Good cofee shop with breakfast available. A bit noisy because of the main road. (Just have an extra beer before going to sleep). Great value would visit again frankfarmer89 wrote a review Dec 2019\n",
      "10 Tried to scam me. I made a booking for 2 rooms for 4 people and the next morning when I got my email they told me that the price of the room has nearly doubled. even though I have confirmation form booking website of the price the hotel says it is double. This is a very unfair practice and not a way to try your customer.  Also ther hotel does not have a swimming pool that is a blatant lie! Qiiq wrote a review Sep 2019\n",
      "10 There is NO POOL despite all the pics on the websiste. Cheap, but don't A very cheap place, in al senses of the word. Large room, many wardrobes and closets, but foul smelling, moldy and the bathroom strongly smells of urine. They sprayed Glade just before we checked in, but that helps only for 20 minutes. The bed is bad, old mattress with the springs coming through, so beware where you put your body. The location is quite awful, on a huge crossing of two busy roads. The traffic noise goes on day and night, big trucks, motorbikes etc. The staff is not very friendly, hardly a good morning and definitely no smiles.  Despite the pretty pictures online, there is NO POOL here!!! One can use the pool of the Grand Jomtien at the end of the road, which has the same owner. In the blistering heat that's quite a hike though. And not what you booked for anyway.  The breakfast next door (venue probably belonging to the hotel, but not included) was good though. Very good coffee and a decent egg on toast. No regular tea to be had with your breakfast though. The room has a kettle and a fridge, but only jasmine tea. There is a safe in the room.

      "50 Good for holiday Good reception and good service mind  Good view from the roof top  Avoid crowded and traffic  Near beach just 5 minutes walk  Cheaper price of the room  Nice place to holiday with family or friends  Hope see you again the circle residence SUTTIPHONG wrote a review Jun 2017\n"
